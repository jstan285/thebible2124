  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <h3><b>The Bible 2124</b> is not just a translation — it’s a new way of listening.</h3>
  <p>A way of meeting God’s word without the noise of fear, tradition, or rigid assumption.
A way of reading that honors both ancient wisdom and the expanding truths we’re still discovering.</p>
  <p><b>This project began with a quiet question:</b></p>
  <p><i>What if we could return to the original texts — not just in language, but in openness?</i></p>
  <p>What if the Bible could be read cleanly —
not as a closed system of answers, but as a living invitation?</p>
  <h2>A New Lens for a New Era</h2>
  <p>We are building a neutral, line-by-line translation of the Bible —
one that honors the source texts while speaking to the heart of this moment.</p>
  <p>We don’t claim to replace the sacred with science,
or to reduce the divine to data.</p>
  <p><b>But we do recognize:</b></p>
  <p>Truth has never belonged to one era, one voice, or one way of seeing.</p>
  <p>In a world now fluent in quantum paradox and unified fields,
our understanding of reality is evolving —
and so, too, must our approach to the texts that shape us.</p>
  <h2>What We’re Creating</h2>
  <p>Right now, our focus is clear:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Translating Scripture one line at a time,
with care, transparency, and reverence for the original languages.</li>
    <li>Documenting every choice, so nothing is hidden and everything can be traced.</li>
    <li>Laying the foundation for a Library where exploration is free, open, and alive.</li>
    <li>We hold nothing back — and let our assumptions fall away first.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>This is the groundwork.</p>
  <p>The quiet part.</p>
  <p>The part before the world sees it fully —
but where the spirit is already moving.</p>
  <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
  <p>This space is for anyone drawn toward a deeper resonance with divine truth —
whether you're rooted in faith, science, both, or something still taking shape.</p>
  <p>It’s for those who have felt shut out by systems,
those who have wandered far,
and those who are just beginning to ask new questions.</p>
  <p>You don’t have to believe to begin.</p>
  <p>You don’t have to agree to belong.</p>
  <p>There is no barrier here, only invitation.</p>
  <h2>Why We Do This</h2>
  <p>Because we believe God’s word is alive —
and that when we strip away the noise, love always speaks.</p>
  <p>We trust that the same Spirit who breathed these words into existence
is still breathing now — into every seeker, every question, every quiet turning toward truth.</p>
  <p>And so we walk gently,
line by line,
building a path back to the beginning
— and forward into something new.</p>
