  <h2>A translation for the future</h2>
  <h3>A clean slate.</h3>
  <p>A fresh rendering of the Bible — open, neutral, and free from tradition or agenda.</p>
  <h3>No persuasion. No expectations. Just space to explore.</h3>
  <p>This is a quiet invitation to begin again —
  to read with new eyes, and discover whatever speaks to <i>you</i>.</p>
