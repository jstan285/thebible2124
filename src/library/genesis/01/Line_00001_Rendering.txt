[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File. 
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]
> In a beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.

[RENDERING NOTES]
> “In a beginning” reflects the absence of the Hebrew definite article in בְּרֵאשִׁית (bereshit).
> “God” renders אֱלֹהִים (elohim), understood grammatically as singular due to verb agreement.
> “Created” reflects בָּרָא (bara), a verb used exclusively for divine creative acts.
> The phrase “the heavens and the earth” reflects the compound object structure marked by dual use of אֵת (et) and definite articles.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]
> Definite articles “the” inserted before “heavens” and “earth” as they are present in the Hebrew (הַשָּׁמַיִם, הָאָרֶץ).
> No pronouns, verbs, or contextual smoothing added.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]
> This line introduces the biblical narrative and establishes the foundational theme of divine creative activity.
> Positioned outside of time-specific reference points — opens a sequence rather than anchors it in linear history.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]
> The root בָּרָא (bara) reappears in 1:21 and 1:27, forming a structural triad marking key acts of creation.
