[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File. 
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]
> And the earth was formless and empty, and darkness was over the face of the deep, and the spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.

[RENDERING NOTES]
> “Formless and empty” reflects the pairing of תֹהוּ וָבֹהוּ (tohu va-vohu), used together in Hebrew to signify total desolation or lack of structure.
> “Darkness was over the face of the deep” directly follows the word order and grammar of the original clause, with “face of the deep” translating עַל־פְּנֵי תְהוֹם (al-penei tehom).
> “Spirit of God was hovering” translates רוּחַ אֱלֹהִים מְרַחֶפֶת, using the participle “hovering” to preserve tense and form.
> The second appearance of עַל־פְּנֵי (“over the face of”) is echoed exactly for structural fidelity.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]
> Inserted “and” at clause openings for continuity and faithfulness to the vav prefix on verbs/nouns.
> No pronouns or interpretive verbs added.
> Definite articles preserved from the original Hebrew where present.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]
> This line introduces the primal conditions before ordered creation — setting the stage for divine action.
> It portrays a state of latent potential, marked by chaos, darkness, and hovering presence.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]
> Mirrors and anticipates line 1:3 where the divine command introduces light into this darkness.
> The dual use of “over the face of” provides symmetry — a visual stillness before the unfolding begins.
