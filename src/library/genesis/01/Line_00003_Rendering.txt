[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File. 
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]
> And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.

[RENDERING NOTES]
> “Said” reflects the root אמר (amar), using standard narrative imperfect to retain declarative tone.
> The phrasing “Let there be light” mirrors the jussive form יְהִי (yehi), reflecting intentional causation.
> “And there was light” comes directly from the fulfillment phrase וַיְהִי־אוֹר (vayhi-or), maintaining temporal immediacy.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]
> Quotation marks used around divine speech for clarity — not present in original Hebrew.
> “There” in “let there be” and “there was” is interpretive for fluidity in English but closely tied to the structure of “yehi” and “vayhi”.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]
> This is the first moment in Genesis where divine speech explicitly causes physical manifestation.
> It connects directly to the line before it — divine Spirit hovering — as an unfolding of potential into form.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]
> Establishes the divine pattern of “speak → manifest” repeated throughout Genesis 1.
> Precedes the separation of light and darkness (v.4), serving as a boundaryless creative moment.
