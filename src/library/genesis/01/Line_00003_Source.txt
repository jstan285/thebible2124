[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]
> The verse features a direct divine speech pattern, with two clauses:
> (1) a jussive command — "let there be light"
> (2) an immediate fulfillment — "and there was light"
> The structure mirrors a declarative speech-act pattern common in Genesis 1.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]
> No known major manuscript variations in this line.
> LXX (Septuagint) parallels the structure closely: καὶ εἶπεν ὁ Θεός· γενηθήτω φῶς· καὶ ἐγένετο φῶς

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]
> This is the first of several “And God said…” structures — recurring throughout Genesis 1 (see vv.6, 9, 11, 14, 20, 24, 26).
> Echoed in 2 Corinthians 4:6: "God, who said, 'Let light shine out of darkness…'"
> Resonates with the theme of divine creative will manifesting immediately into form.
