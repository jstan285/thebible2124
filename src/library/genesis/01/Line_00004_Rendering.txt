[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And God saw the light, that it was good. And God separated between the light and between the darkness.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Saw” translates וַיַּרְא (vayyar), using the standard narrative verb form, indicating divine perception or recognition.
“The light” (הָאוֹר) includes the definite article; the object is marked with אֶת־ (et).
“That it was good” translates כִּי־טוֹב (ki-tov), where כִּי introduces a clause of evaluation.
“Separated” renders וַיַּבְדֵּל (vayavdel), a causative verb indicating division or distinction.
The double phrase “between the light and between the darkness” follows the Hebrew structure “bein...uvein...”.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

Inserted definite articles (“the”) for ha’or and hachoshekh.
Added “that it was” in “that it was good” for grammatical clarity in English.
“And” inserted at start of second clause to mirror Hebrew vav-consecutive.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

This line follows the divine utterance of light and shows the first divine evaluation (“good”).
It also marks the beginning of separation in the created order — a transition from unified emergence to structured distinction.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

The verb וַיַּבְדֵּל (vayavdel) reappears in Genesis 1:6 and 1:14, signaling a repeating pattern of divine separation.
This line continues the “word → light → judgment → separation” progression of the opening creation sequence.
