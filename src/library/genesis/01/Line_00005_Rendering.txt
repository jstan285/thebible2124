[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And it was evening, and it was morning — one day.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Called” reflects both וַיִּקְרָא (vayiqra) and קָרָא (qara), from the same root, meaning to name or proclaim.
The objects “light” and “darkness” are each given new identities (“Day” and “Night”) through divine naming.
“And it was evening, and it was morning” uses the repeated וַיְהִי (vayhi), preserving the narrative rhythm.
“One day” translates יוֹם אֶחָד (yom echad), preserving the original ordering where “one” may signify both quantity and unity.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

Definite articles “the” added before “light” and “darkness” for clarity, consistent with original Hebrew.
“He” inserted for clarity between second naming verb and subject.
Em dash added in “— one day” to capture narrative pause without interpretive smoothing.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

This line completes the first creation cycle — moving from utterance and observation to naming and temporal structuring.
It establishes a divine framework for time and order, transitioning from the undefined into measured intervals.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

The naming formula (“called X Y”) recurs throughout Genesis 1.
The evening-morning pairing introduces a rhythm that structures the six days of creation.
“Yom echad” sets the foundation for all subsequent days, not merely numerically but conceptually.

This rendering is provided for orientation only.
It draws from the Line Source File and reflects the structure of the original text as faithfully as possible, while adapting to minimal English phrasing.
Interpretive meaning is not asserted. For lexical and grammatical details, consult the Line Source File.
