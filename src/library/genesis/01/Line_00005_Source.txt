[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

The structure contains two naming acts (“vayiqra... qara”), assigning terms to light and darkness.
Two temporal markers follow: “and it was evening, and it was morning,” forming a complete cycle.
Repetition of “vayhi” suggests narrative transition and rhythmic cadence.
The final phrase "yom echad" marks the first of the creative intervals, introducing temporal structuring.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

No significant textual variants known for this verse in major witnesses.
Consistent across Leningrad Codex, Aleppo Codex (where extant), and aligned with Masoretic tradition.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

The use of "vayhi" connects directly to 1:3 and repeats in 1:8, 1:13, etc.
"Yom echad" sets a structural template for “second day” and onward, marking ordered creation stages.
