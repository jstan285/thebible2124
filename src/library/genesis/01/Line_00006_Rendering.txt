[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And God said, “Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it be separating between waters and waters.”

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Said” translates וַיֹּאמֶר (vayomer), maintaining narrative introduction of divine speech.
“Let there be” reflects יְהִי (yehi), in the jussive form signaling permissive creation.
“Expanse” renders רָקִיעַ (raqia), meaning an extended surface or firmament.
“In the midst of the waters” translates בְּתוֹךְ הַמָּיִם (betokh ha-mayim), indicating spatial placement.
“Let it be separating” reflects וִיהִי מַבְדִּיל (vihi mavdil), using a jussive plus a participial form for function.
“Between waters and waters” reflects בֵּין מַיִם לָמָיִם (bein mayim la-mayim), a Hebrew idiom for spatial division.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

Quotation marks used for clarity of divine speech — not present in original.
“The” inserted before “waters” to reflect definite article in Hebrew.
“An” added before “expanse” to reflect English usage.
“It be separating” adapts participle for functional clarity in English.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

This line initiates a second major creative act — introducing structure by division.
Marks the first explicit reference to space (raqia) between previously unified elements (waters).
Builds from earlier separations (light/dark) and anticipates future distinctions (day/night, land/sea).

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Continues the recurring divine speech → command → action pattern.
The concept of “raqia” recurs in 1:7–8, anchoring this moment within a sequence of atmospheric distinctions.
Echoes the separation motif from verse 4, extending the theme of divine ordering.
