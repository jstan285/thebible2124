[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

The verse follows the recurring Genesis 1 structure: divine speech introduced by “vayomer Elohim” → jussive command → fulfillment statement.

“Yehi raqia” presents a command form for creation of a new element.

The participial “mavdil” indicates an ongoing or defining function of separation.

The phrase “bein… la-” is a common Hebrew structure for distinguishing divisions.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

No significant differences noted between Masoretic Text (Leningrad Codex) and major Dead Sea Scroll fragments in this verse.

Septuagint (LXX) renders “raqia” as στερέωμα (stereōma, “firmament/solid structure”), influencing later interpretations.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

This is the second instance of “vayomer Elohim” (following Genesis 1:3), part of the recurring divine speech acts.

The theme of separation (badal) echoes Genesis 1:4 (light/darkness) and recurs in Genesis 1:14 (day/night, seasons).

The concept of “raqia” appears again in Genesis 1:7–8 and in Psalm 19:1, Ezekiel 1:22–26.
