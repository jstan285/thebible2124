[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And God made the expanse, and separated between the waters that were beneath the expanse and between the waters that were above the expanse. And it was so.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Made” translates וַיַּעַשׂ (vayya‘as), a Qal imperfect verb with vav-consecutive, indicating completed action.
“The expanse” renders הָרָקִיעַ (ha-raqia), retaining the definite article.
“Separated” reflects וַיַּבְדֵּל (vayyavdel), maintaining causative force of separation.
“Between the waters…” reflects בֵּין הַמַּיִם… וּבֵין הַמַּיִם, preserving parallel structure.
“That were beneath…” and “that were above…” translate אֲשֶׁר מִתַּחַת… and אֲשֶׁר מֵעַל…, keeping directional nuance.
“And it was so” reflects וַיְהִי־כֵן (vayhi-ken), a formulaic fulfillment clause.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

Added “that were” for clarity in relative clauses.
“The” added before “expanse” and “waters” to reflect Hebrew definiteness.
“And” inserted before each main clause to reflect Hebrew vav-consecutives.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

This line fulfills the command given in Genesis 1:6.
It confirms divine action, emphasizing separation and the ordering of primordial waters into layered structure.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Repeats the “made → separated” sequence used across Genesis 1.
Uses the “bein… uvein…” separation formula consistent with lines 1:4 and 1:6.
Ends with the fulfillment phrase “and it was so,” anchoring this verse within the creation rhythm.
