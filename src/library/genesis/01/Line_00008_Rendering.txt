[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And God called the expanse “heavens.” And it was evening, and it was morning — second day.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Called” reflects וַיִּקְרָא (vayiqra), preserving the naming function in direct speech form.
“The expanse” renders לָרָקִיעַ (la-raqia), with prefixed definite article intact.
“Heavens” translates שָׁמָיִם (shamayim), a plural or dual-form noun referring to sky or celestial realms.
“And it was evening, and it was morning” preserves the repeated structure of Genesis 1 temporal phrasing.
“Second day” translates יוֹם שֵׁנִי (yom sheni), combining noun and ordinal adjective.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

Quotation marks added around “heavens” to clarify naming.
“And” added at each clause opening to maintain rhythm and reflect Hebrew vav-consecutives.
Em dash added before “second day” to mirror pacing of earlier lines.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

This line concludes the creation of the raqia from the previous verse and assigns its identity as “heavens.”
Reinforces temporal rhythm established in Genesis 1:5, marking the completion of the second creation phase.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Mirrors the structure of Genesis 1:5 — naming followed by temporal conclusion.
Confirms the fulfillment of the divine action begun in Genesis 1:6–7.
