[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

The naming formula (“vayiqra Elohim…”) parallels Genesis 1:5, where God names “day” and “night.”

The expanse is identified as “shamayim” (heavens/skies), providing its function and identity.

The formulaic refrain “vayhi-erev vayhi-voqer yom sheni” mirrors Genesis 1:5, marking ordered time progression.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

No major variants are noted between MT and DSS fragments for this verse.

Septuagint uses οὐρανός (ouranos, “heaven/sky”) for “shamayim.”

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Continues the “raqia” theme from Genesis 1:6–7.

Echoes the structure of Genesis 1:5 (“naming” + evening/morning refrain).

The recurring day formula repeats across Genesis 1 (vv. 5, 8, 13, 19, 23, 31).
