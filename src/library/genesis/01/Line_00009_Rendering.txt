[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And God said, “Let the waters be gathered from beneath the heavens to one place, and let the dry land be seen.” And it was so.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Said” translates וַיֹּאמֶר (vayomer), a common divine speech introduction.
“Let the waters be gathered” reflects יִקָּווּ (yiqqavu), Niphal imperfect form indicating passive action with intent.
“From beneath the heavens” translates מִתַּחַת הַשָּׁמַיִם (mitachat ha-shamayim), preserving spatial origin.
“To one place” translates אֶל־מָקוֹם אֶחָד (el-makom echad), denoting unity of destination.
“Let the dry land be seen” reflects וְתֵרָאֶה הַיַּבָּשָׁה (ve-tera’eh ha-yabashah), maintaining imperative nuance.
“And it was so” (וַיְהִי־כֵן) affirms divine fulfillment.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

Quotation marks added for clarity of divine speech.
“The” before “waters,” “heavens,” and “dry land” reflects Hebrew definite articles.
“Let” added to reflect jussive command forms.
No major helper phrases outside those structurally mirrored.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Follows structural divisions of water and space (vv.6–8), now commanding terrestrial emergence.
Precedes the naming of “land” and “seas” in verse 10 — this line sets the stage for further classification.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Continues divine speech → command → fulfillment pattern.
Dual command structure (gathering + appearance) echoes separation and organization motifs.
“Vayhi-ken” clause anchors fulfillment and parallels earlier divine actions (vv. 7, 8).
