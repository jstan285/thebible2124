[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

The verse begins with a speech formula followed by two coordinated jussive verbs (“yiqqavu… ve-tera’eh”).

Parallelism between gathering of waters and appearance of dry land is emphasized.

The formula “vayhi-ken” affirms fulfillment, as in vv.7, 11, 15, 24.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

No significant textual variants between MT and DSS fragments for this verse.

Septuagint: συναχθήτω τὸ ὕδωρ… καὶ ὀφθήτω ἡ ξηρά (“let the water be gathered… and let the dry land be seen”).

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Builds on Genesis 1:6–8 (division of waters).

Prepares for Genesis 1:10, which gives names (“yabashah” = land, “mayim” = seas).

Parallel gathering/appearance structure is echoed in Exodus 14:21–22 (Red Sea parting).
