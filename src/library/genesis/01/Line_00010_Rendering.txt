[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And God called the dry land “Earth,” and the gathering of the waters He called “Seas.” And God saw that it was good.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Called” reflects both וַיִּקְרָא (vayiqra) and קָרָא (qara) — keeping consistent naming structure.
“The dry land” translates לַיַּבָּשָׁה (la-yabashah), retaining the definite article.
“Earth” for אֶרֶץ (erets) preserves the conceptual use across Genesis.
“Gathering of the waters” reflects וּלְמִקְוֵה הַמַּיִם (ulemikveh ha-mayim), maintaining collective nuance.
“Seas” renders יַמִּים (yamim), plural form of “sea.”
“God saw that it was good” follows the evaluative phrase וַיַּרְא אֱלֹהִים כִּי־טוֹב (vayyar Elohim ki-tov).

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

Quotation marks added for clarity of named elements.
“The” added before “dry land” and “gathering” to match Hebrew definiteness.
“He” added before second “called” for subject clarity.
“That it was” inserted in evaluation phrase for flow.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Follows from the emergence of land and water in verse 9.
Provides formal names to these domains, reinforcing identity and structure.
First evaluation since verse 8 — confirms divine approval.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Two-part naming structure: land and sea.
Ends with standard “God saw… good” refrain.
Mirrors earlier verse 5 (naming day/night) and verse 8 (naming heavens).
