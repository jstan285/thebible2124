[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And God said, “Let the earth sprout vegetation — grass, plants bearing seed, fruit trees making fruit according to its kind, whose seed is in it — upon the earth.” And it was so.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Said” from וַיֹּאמֶר (vayomer), standard divine speech introduction.
“Let the earth sprout” translates תַּדְשֵׁא (tad’she), Hiphil form, signaling causative emergence.
“Vegetation” combines דֶּשֶׁא (deshe) and עֵשֶׂב (esev) — “grass” and “plant,” respectively.
“Bearing seed” reflects מַזְרִיעַ זֶרַע (mazria zera), a participle construction emphasizing action.
“Fruit trees” from עֵץ פְּרִי (etz peri), followed by participial phrase “making fruit.”
“According to its kind” is לְמִינוֹ (le-mino), common Genesis taxonomic phrase.
“Whose seed is in it” = אֲשֶׁר זַרְעוֹ־בוֹ (asher zar‘o-vo), clarifying internal generativity.
“Upon the earth” = עַל־הָאָרֶץ (al ha-aretz), reasserting terrestrial domain.
Closes with וַיְהִי־כֵן (vayhi-ken): “And it was so.”

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

Quotation marks added to frame direct speech.
Em dash inserted for clarity in vegetation list.
“Let” used to mark jussive intent of divine command.
“Is” added in “whose seed is in it” for English readability.
“Making” used to preserve participial aspect of עֹשֶׂה (oseh).

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Follows naming and structuring of Earth and Seas (v.10).
Marks the first biological emergence — plant life.
Establishes generativity and classification before fauna are introduced.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

First command to the earth to generate autonomously.
Thematic echo of separation and structure — now applied to organic systems.
Prepares for fulfillment in v.12 and provisioning themes in v.29.
