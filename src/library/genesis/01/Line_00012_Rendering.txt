[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And the earth brought forth grass, plants bearing seed according to its kind, and trees making fruit whose seed is in it — according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Brought forth” renders וַתּוֹצֵא (vatotze), causative verb — earth as initiator.
“Grass” and “plants bearing seed” maintain distinction between דֶּשֶׁא (deshe) and עֵשֶׂב מַזְרִיעַ זֶרַע (esev mazria zera).
“According to its kind” is repeated twice — לְמִינֵהוּ (le-minehu) — anchoring species or order integrity.
“Trees making fruit” from עֵץ עֹשֶׂה פְּרִי (etz oseh peri) retains present participle for ongoing action.
“Whose seed is in it” is a direct rendering of אֲשֶׁר זַרְעוֹ־בוֹ (asher zar‘o-vo), emphasizing internal generativity.
“And God saw that it was good” preserves the evaluative phrase וַיַּרְא אֱלֹהִים כִּי־טוֹב (vayyar Elohim ki-tov).

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“The” added before “earth,” “plants,” and “trees” for clarity and alignment with Hebrew definiteness.
Em dash added before second “according to its kind” for readability.
“Is” inserted in “whose seed is in it.”
No smoothing beyond minimal grammatical necessity.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Fulfillment of the divine command in v.11.
Establishes successful execution of Earth’s generative capacity.
Solidifies vegetative categories ahead of temporal framing in v.13.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Follows Genesis 1 pattern: command → action → observation → approval.
Repetition of “according to its kind” underscores emphasis on differentiated order.
Ends with evaluative refrain (ki-tov) — fifth such moment.
