[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And it was evening, and it was morning — the third day.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“And it was evening” = וַיְהִי־עֶרֶב (vayhi-erev), standard close to the creative day.
“And it was morning” = וַיְהִי־בֹקֶר (vayhi-voqer), in sequence with evening.
“The third day” from יוֹם שְׁלִישִׁי (yom shelishi) — masculine singular ordinal structure.
Follows identical syntactic pattern to Genesis 1:5 and 1:8.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

Em dash added for rhythm and pause before day identifier.
“The” before “third day” added for English readability.
No interpretive or smoothing language included.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Concludes the third day of creation, which encompassed land emergence (v.9), naming (v.10), and vegetation (vv.11–12).
The refrains “evening” and “morning” function as temporal bookends and sacred pacing markers.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Third repetition of the evening-morning formula, anchoring Genesis 1’s rhythm.
Each repetition strengthens the cycle of order, closure, and progression.
Prepares reader for the shift to celestial bodies in verse 14.
