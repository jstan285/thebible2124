This isn’t a lesson. It’s a space. Come as you are. Let the line speak to you.

[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And they were as lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth. And it was so.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“They were” from וְהָיוּ (vehayu), indicating realized state from command.
“As lights” = לִמְאֹרוֹת (li-me’orot), retaining plural sense of light-giving sources.
“In the expanse of the heavens” renders בִּרְקִיעַ הַשָּׁמַיִם (birqia ha-shamayim), consistent with earlier phrasing (v.14).
“To give light” = לְהָאִיר (le-ha’ir), Hiphil infinitive — purpose clause.
“Upon the earth” = עַל־הָאָרֶץ (al-ha-aretz), matches use from previous light passages.
“And it was so” = וַיְהִי־כֵן (vayhi-ken), standard Genesis 1 confirmation refrain.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“As” inserted before “lights” to track לְ as function indicator.
“The” added before “expanse,” “heavens,” and “earth” to reflect definite articles.
“To give” used to reflect infinitive construct “le-ha’ir.”
No interpretive smoothing added.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Confirms execution of luminary purpose given in v.14.
Represents the realized function of cosmic bodies before their naming (v.16).

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Second part of the command-fulfillment sequence: v.14 = declaration; v.15 = realization.
Parallels structure from days 1–3: intention → action → validation.
“Vayhi-ken” ties it to other creation milestones.
