[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

This verse continues the command from v.14 with purpose (“to give light upon the earth”).

It employs an infinitive construct (“le-ha’ir”) to express the function of the luminaries.

The closing “vayhi-ken” is the standard fulfillment marker in Genesis 1.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

MT and DSS are consistent.

Septuagint: “καὶ ἔστωσαν εἰς φωστῆρας… τοῦ φαίνειν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς” (“and let them be for lights… to shine upon the earth”), closely paralleling Hebrew structure.

Samaritan Pentateuch aligns with MT wording.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Builds on v.14’s introduction of luminaries and anticipates their making in v.16.

Function of illumination echoes Genesis 1:3–4 (light vs. darkness).

“Vayhi-ken” refrain appears in vv.7, 9, 11, 24, serving as divine confirmation.
