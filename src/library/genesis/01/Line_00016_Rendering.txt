[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And God made the two great lights — the greater light for rule over the day, and the lesser light for rule over the night — and the stars.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“And God made” = וַיַּעַשׂ אֱלֹהִים (vayya‘as Elohim), standard creative action phrase.
“The two great lights” = שְׁנֵי הַמְּאֹרֹת הַגְּדֹלִים (shnei ha-me’orot ha-gedolim), dual with adjective, pluralized.
“Greater light” = הַמָּאוֹר הַגָּדוֹל (ha-ma’or ha-gadol) — functional magnitude, not necessarily physical size.
“For rule over the day” = לְמֶמְשֶׁלֶת הַיּוֹם (le-memshelet ha-yom), using לְ + memshalah to signal purpose/dominion.
“Lesser light” = הַמָּאוֹר הַקָּטֹן (ha-ma’or ha-qaton) — relational pairing to greater.
“For rule over the night” = לְמֶמְשֶׁלֶת הַלַּיְלָה (le-memshelet ha-laylah), mirroring day phrase.
“And the stars” = וְאֵת הַכּוֹכָבִים (ve-et ha-kokhavim), appended third clause — not given separate role here.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“The” added consistently to reflect definite articles.
Em dashes used to mirror Hebrew structure and allow pacing.
“For rule over” reflects prepositional lamed and memshalah noun without smoothing.
No interpretive expansions added.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Realizes and specifies the “lights” mentioned in vv.14–15.
Details divine allocation of cosmic governance — day/night management.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Mirrors previous creation rhythm: declaration → placement → function.
Continues symmetry between paired elements (light/dark, day/night, great/lesser).
Introduction of stars as additive coda — reinforcing completeness.
