[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

The verse uses a threefold structure: “two great lights” → their specific functions (day/night) → addition of stars.

The great/lesser distinction is functional (day/night governance), not necessarily size-related.

The particle “et” marks each object of divine making.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

MT and DSS align closely.

Septuagint renders “two great lights” as “δύο φωστῆρες τοὺς μεγάλους” (two great luminaries).

Samaritan Pentateuch matches MT.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Direct fulfillment of the command in vv.14–15.

Anticipates v.17, where God sets them in the expanse.

Echoes “rule” motif found again in Psalm 136:7–9.
