[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And God set them in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Set” from וַיִּתֵּן (vayyiten), literally “gave,” rendered here as “set” to reflect spatial placement.
“Them” = אֹתָם (otam), 3rd person masculine plural — refers to the luminaries from v.16.
“In the expanse of the heavens” = בִּרְקִיעַ הַשָּׁמָיִם (birqia ha-shamayim), same phrasing as v.14 and v.15.
“To give light” = לְהָאִיר (le-ha’ir), Hiphil infinitive — emphasizes illuminating purpose.
“Upon the earth” = עַל־הָאָרֶץ (al-ha-aretz), consistent with previous use.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“Set” substituted for “gave” to better convey spatial intention.
“The” added to “expanse,” “heavens,” and “earth” for clarity and article match.
“To give” used for Hiphil infinitive; no smoothing added.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Describes execution of luminary placement after their creation in v.16.
Fulfills function introduced in v.14 and reinforced in v.15.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Continues three-verse arc of divine light assignment: command (v.14), function (v.15), placement (v.17).
Mirrors other Genesis 1 patterns: action + purpose.
