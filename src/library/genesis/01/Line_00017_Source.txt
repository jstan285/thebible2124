[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

This verse describes God actively “placing” the luminaries in the expanse of the heavens.

Infinitive “le-ha’ir” gives their purpose: illumination upon the earth.

Continues the sequential structure of divine command → fulfillment.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

MT and DSS align; no major divergences.

Septuagint: “καὶ ἔθηκεν αὐτὰ ὁ θεὸς ἐν τῷ στερεώματι τοῦ οὐρανοῦ τοῦ φαίνειν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς” (“and God placed them in the firmament of heaven to shine upon the earth”).

Samaritan Pentateuch agrees with MT.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Directly continues the luminary creation in v.16.

Parallel purpose clause to v.15 (“to give light on the earth”).

Prepares for v.18, which adds governing/separating functions.
