[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

To rule over the day and over the night, and to separate between the light and between the darkness. And God saw that it was good.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“To rule” = וְלִמְשֹׁל (ve-limshol), infinitive construct with prefixed conjunction — purpose clause.
“Over the day and over the night” translates בַּיּוֹם וּבַלַּיְלָה, retaining dual governance.
“To separate” = וּלְהַבְדִּיל (u-le-havdil), second infinitive construct, in parallel with “to rule.”
“Between the light and between the darkness” = בֵּין הָאוֹר וּבֵין הַחֹשֶׁךְ, duplication of “between” (בֵּין) retains poetic emphasis.
“And God saw that it was good” = וַיַּרְא אֱלֹהִים כִּי־טוֹב (vayyar Elohim ki-tov), repeated evaluative formula.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“Over” inserted to clarify governing domains.
“To” reflects purpose-driven infinitive forms.
“That it was” added to preserve the common rendering of כִּי־טוֹב.
No smoothing or embellishments added.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Clarifies the functions assigned to luminaries after their creation and placement (vv.16–17).
Emphasizes divine order through governance and distinction.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Mirrors v.4, where God separates light and darkness directly — here mediated by luminaries.
Part of the four-verse arc (vv.14–18) defining the role of lights.
Ends with standard evaluative refrain — thematic closure.
