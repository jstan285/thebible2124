[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

Two infinitive constructs (“ve-limshol,” “u-le-havdil”) express purposes of the luminaries.

The structure continues the sequence of divine placement (v.17) with governing and separating functions.

The verse concludes with the evaluative refrain “ki-tov.”

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

MT and DSS consistent.

LXX: “καὶ ἄρχειν τῆς ἡμέρας καὶ τῆς νυκτός καὶ διαχωρίζειν ἀνὰ μέσον τοῦ φωτὸς καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον τοῦ σκότους· καὶ εἶδεν ὁ θεὸς ὅτι καλόν” (“to rule the day and the night, and to separate between the light and the darkness; and God saw that it was good”).

Samaritan Pentateuch matches MT.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Completes the functional explanation of luminaries begun in v.14.

Parallels v.4 (God separating light from darkness).

The phrase “God saw that it was good” recurs (vv.4, 10, 12, 21, 25, 31), marking divine evaluation.
