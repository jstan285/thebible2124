[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And it was evening, and it was morning — fourth day.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“And it was evening” = וַיְהִי־עֶרֶב (vayhi-erev), consistent phrase from prior creation days.
“And it was morning” = וַיְהִי־בֹקֶר (vayhi-voqer), parallel structure.
“Fourth day” = יוֹם רְבִיעִי (yom revi‘i), ordinal use of “four” matching day-sequence formula.
Em dash used in English to indicate poetic pause between sequence and day name.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

No insertions needed.
Em dash used for pacing — matches structural cadence of Hebrew.
Articles (“the”) not added to “day” as not present in Hebrew text.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Concludes the fourth creation day, specifically the creation and assignment of luminaries (vv.14–18).
Marks temporal closure — evening/morning cycle confirms time-function alignment.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Echoes refrain from vv.5, 8, 13 — establishing liturgical cadence.
Serves as a rhythmic checkpoint in the creation narrative.
Embeds pattern recognition — sacred time begins in evening.
