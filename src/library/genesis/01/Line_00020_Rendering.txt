[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And God said: Let the waters swarm with a swarm of living soul, and let the bird fly over the earth across the face of the expanse of the heavens.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Let…swarm” from יִשְׁרְצוּ (yishretzu), 3rd person plural Qal imperfect — permissive jussive form.
“Swarm of living soul” renders שֶׁרֶץ נֶפֶשׁ חַיָּה (sheretz nefesh chayyah) — teeming creature with living being.
“Let the bird fly” from יְעוֹפֵף (‘ye‘ofef), Polel imperfect — emphasizes fluttering, active motion.
“Over the earth…face of the expanse” preserves spatial dual-preposition structure: עַל־הָאָרֶץ עַל־פְּנֵי רְקִיעַ הַשָּׁמַיִם.
Maintains Hebrew parallelism between water-bound teeming and sky-borne movement.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“Let” inserted for jussive command tone — matches Genesis 1 stylistic precedent.
“With a” inserted for smoother English readability around “swarm of living soul.”
“The” added to “waters,” “earth,” “expanse,” and “heavens” to reflect Hebrew definite articles.
“And” at mid-point retained from Hebrew vav.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Begins Day Five of creation — introduces first mobile, animate life.
First appearance of “living soul” (nefesh chayyah) — foundational term for creaturely life.
Establishes dual creation domains: aquatic and aerial.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Structural parallel to v.11 (“Let the earth sprout vegetation”) — domain-based creative command.
Prepares linguistic and thematic frame for v.21, where this command is fulfilled.
Repetition of motion verbs (swarm, fly) signals animate abundance.
