[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And God blessed them, saying: Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let the bird multiply in the land.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Blessed them” = וַיְבָרֶךְ אֹתָם (vayvarekh otam), first use of divine blessing in the creation narrative.
“Saying” = לֵאמֹר (lemor), introduces direct speech.
Imperatives “be fruitful,” “multiply,” “fill” directed toward sea life.
“Let the bird multiply” uses imperfect יִרֶב (yirev), third person singular — ongoing process.
“In the seas” = בַּיַּמִּים (ba-yamim), and “in the land” = בָּאָרֶץ (ba-aretz), mark domain-specific fruitfulness.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“And” added for clause continuity — traces to Hebrew vav prefix.
“Let” inserted to express jussive form in final clause.
No articles or adjectives added beyond source.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Immediately follows creation of marine and aerial life in v.21.
Marks first instance of God blessing creation — introduces a new divine mode.
Opens thematic trajectory of fruitfulness and generativity, echoed later with humanity.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Introduces three imperatives in parallel: be fruitful, multiply, fill — a generative triad.
Blessing diverges from prior “God said / it was so” formula — represents divine engagement beyond command.
“Multiply” used for both sea and air creatures, structurally linking domains.
