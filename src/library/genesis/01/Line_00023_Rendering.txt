[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And it was evening, and it was morning — fifth day.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“And it was evening” = וַיְהִי־עֶרֶב (vayhi-erev), standard narrative closing phrase.
“And it was morning” = וַיְהִי־בֹקֶר (vayhi-voqer), paired with evening for structural rhythm.
“Day” = יוֹם (yom), consistent with previous usages.
“Fifth” = חֲמִישִׁי (chamishi), ordinal adjective marking sequence.
No verbs or articles beyond the refrain’s syntax; phrasing is formulaic and minimal.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

En dash used between “morning” and “fifth day” for clarity; no English words inserted beyond what the Hebrew directly supports.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Serves as the closure formula for the fifth creation day.
Comes after creation and blessing of marine and winged life (vv.20–22).
Reinforces the structured rhythm of the Genesis 1 sequence.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Parallels vv.5, 8, 13, and 19 — reinforces temporal progression and divine intentionality.
Maintains six-day creative arc leading to climactic rest on Day Seven.
Each “evening and morning” pair forms narrative punctuation for a complete phase of creation.
