[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And God said: Let the earth bring forth living soul according to its kind — cattle, and crawling things, and the wild animal of the earth according to its kind. And it was so.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Let…bring forth” from תּוֹצֵא (totze), Hiphil imperfect — causative jussive: the earth is called to produce.
“Living soul” = נֶפֶשׁ חַיָּה (nefesh chayyah), continuing terminology from earlier animate life (1:20).
“According to its kind” = לְמִינָהּ (leminah), repeated twice for ordered classification.
Three categories:
• בְּהֵמָה (behemah) — domestic animals, beasts of burden
• רֶמֶשׂ (remes) — small creeping things (insects, reptiles)
• חַיְתוֹ־אֶרֶץ (chayto-erets) — wild animals of the land
Final clause וַיְהִי־כֵן (vayhi ken) — the fulfillment refrain (“and it was so”).

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“Let” inserted to reflect jussive construction.
“The” added for natural readability in “the earth” and “the wild animal.”
“And” connects items as in Hebrew conjunction ו (vav).
Em dash used for clarity between clauses.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Initiates Day Six of creation — the emergence of terrestrial animals.
Continuation of animate creation from Day Five (marine/sky), now extended to land.
Prepares conceptual ground for the creation of humanity in the next verses.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Parallels vv.20–21 structurally — “Let [domain] bring forth [lifeform] according to kind.”
Establishes a tripartite taxonomy of land life.
Echoed in v.25’s fulfillment structure; forms a call/response pattern.
Part of a crescendo toward human creation.
