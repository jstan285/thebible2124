[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And God made the wild animal of the earth according to its kind, and the cattle according to its kind, and every creeping thing of the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Made” from וַיַּעַשׂ (vayya‘as), Qal imperfect — action verb, continuation of creation.
Order follows triadic structure:
• חַיַּת הָאָרֶץ (wild animal of the earth)
• הַבְּהֵמָה (the cattle, domestic animals)
• כָּל־רֶמֶשׂ הָאֲדָמָה (every creeping thing of the ground)
“According to its kind” repeated with gender-specific suffixes (לְמִינָהּ, לְמִינֵהוּ) for precision.
Final evaluative clause וַיַּרְא אֱלֹהִים כִּי־טוֹב (and God saw that it was good) affirms quality and intention.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

Definite articles “the” inserted for clarity in English.
No English helper words beyond structure markers.
“Every” reflects Hebrew כָּל־ (kol) for completeness of the creeping creatures.
Phrasing closely follows Hebrew word order with minor smoothing for readability.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

This is the fulfillment of the command issued in verse 24.
Represents completion of terrestrial life before the creation of humanity.
Affirms life’s ordered diversity with divine approval.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Echoes structural logic of verse 21 (sea/sky creatures) — command (vv.20, 24), then fulfillment (vv.21, 25).
Functions as a paired clause with v.24, finalizing Day Six’s initial phase.
Closing phrase “God saw that it was good” appears throughout Genesis 1 — literary refrain emphasizing coherence and goodness.
