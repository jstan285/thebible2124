[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

A divine “let us” formulation appears uniquely here, signaling deliberation.

Humanity is created in relation to God’s “image” (tselem) and “likeness” (demut).

Mandate of dominion is comprehensive: sea, sky, land animals, creeping things, the earth.

Parallel structures “be-tsalmenu / ki-demutenu” and “ve-yirdu / u-ve-khol…” emphasize likeness and function.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

MT and DSS agree.

Septuagint: “καὶ εἶπεν ὁ θεός· ποιήσωμεν ἄνθρωπον κατ’ εἰκόνα ἡμετέραν καὶ καθ’ ὁμοίωσιν” (“let us make man according to our image and according to our likeness”), using ποιέω (to make).

Samaritan Pentateuch matches MT.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Culmination of the pattern of creature-making (vv.20–25).

Prepares for fulfillment in v.27, where the verb “bara” (create) is reintroduced.

Anticipates the blessing and commission in v.28.

The dominion formula parallels Psalm 8:6–8.
