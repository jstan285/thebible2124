[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

So God created the human in his image; in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.

[RENDERING NOTES]

Repetition of “created” (bara) three times — emphatic poetic structure.
“The human” (ha-adam) used generically, not yet gender-specific.
“In his image / in the image of God” — deliberate mirror phrasing.
Object pronouns shift from singular (him) to plural (them), indicating collective identity.
“Male and female” are stated without hierarchy — presenting binary within unified humanity.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“So” reflects narrative continuation.
Semicolons used to mark poetic colons.
“The” added for readability with “human”; no conceptual additions.
No interpretive smoothing added.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

This is the fulfillment of the decision stated in verse 26.
It declares human origin as divine act and divine resemblance.
Sets up the blessing and directive in verse 28.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Three-part poetic structure: create – image – gender pairing.
Follows Hebraic poetic parallelism, reinforcing divine intentionality.
Echoed in Genesis 5:1–2 with similar structure and phrasing.
