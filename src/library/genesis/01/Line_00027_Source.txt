[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

This verse is poetic in form, with three parallel cola:

“God created the human in his image.”

“In the image of God he created him.”

“Male and female he created them.”

Repetition of ברא (bara’) emphasizes divine creative act.

Singular “oto” and plural “otam” highlight humanity as both unified and diverse.

Male and female together constitute the fullness of “adam.”

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

Septuagint: “καὶ ἐποίησεν ὁ θεὸς τὸν ἄνθρωπον· κατ’ εἰκόνα θεοῦ ἐποίησεν αὐτόν· ἄρσεν καὶ θῆλυ ἐποίησεν αὐτούς” (“and God made man; according to the image of God he made him; male and female he made them”).

Samaritan Pentateuch matches MT.
