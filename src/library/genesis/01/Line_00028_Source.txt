[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

The verse shifts from creation to blessing, marking divine approval and commissioning.

Five imperatives structure the mandate: “pru” (be fruitful), “revu” (multiply), “milu” (fill), “kivshuhah” (subdue), “redu” (rule).

Scope of dominion spans sea, sky, and land creatures, echoing v.26.

Blessing + speech formula parallels v.22 (creatures of sea/sky), but here includes subjugation and rulership.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

MT and DSS consistent.

LXX: “Εὐλόγησεν αὐτοὺς ὁ θεὸς λέγων· αὐξάνεσθε καὶ πληθύνεσθε καὶ πληρώσατε τὴν γῆν καὶ κατακυριεύσατε αὐτῆς· καὶ ἄρχετε τῶν ἰχθύων τῆς θαλάσσης καὶ τῶν πετεινῶν τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ πάντων τῶν κτηνῶν” (“God blessed them saying: increase and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and rule the fish of the sea and the birds of heaven and all animals”).

Samaritan Pentateuch aligns with MT.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Expands v.27 by giving humanity its commission.

Echoes blessing language first given to sea/sky creatures in v.22.

Anticipates Psalm 8:6–8 (“dominion over works of your hands”).

Establishes human vocation before provision (vv.29–30).
