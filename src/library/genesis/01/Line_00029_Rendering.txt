[FILE TYPE]: Line Rendering

[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And God said, “See, I have given you every plant bearing seed that is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree that has in it seed-bearing fruit — it shall be for food for you.”

[RENDERING NOTES]

Begins with divine speech (“And God said”).
“See” (hineh) emphasizes divine announcement or gift.
Two food sources listed: (1) seed-bearing plants, (2) trees with seed-bearing fruit.
Purpose clause: “it shall be for food for you.”
The repeated root “zera” (seed) underscores reproduction, continuity, sustainability.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

Quotation marks added to mark divine speech.
“That is” and “has in it” are insertions for readability from “asher” and “bo.”
No interpretive smoothing or conceptual additions beyond structure.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Follows the human mandate in verse 28 — provision is given alongside commission.
Introduces divine-human relationship of sustenance and shared earth.
Sets up contrast with Genesis 2, where access to certain trees is limited.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Parallel to v.30 (food for animals).
Completes the pattern of blessing + instruction + provision.
Uses familiar Torah phrase “behold, I have given you…” seen also in covenantal moments.
