[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the skies, and to everything that creeps upon the earth — that has in it a living soul — I have given every green plant for food. And it was so.

[RENDERING NOTES]

Follows parallel structure: three categories of animals named.
“That has in it a living soul” applies as a qualifying clause.
Object of gift is “every green plant,” aligned with verse 29.
Ends with standard fulfillment phrase “and it was so” (vayhi-ken).
Reflects divine provision extending beyond humanity to all sentient creation.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

Quotation implied from context of v.29 speech; quotation marks not inserted here for continuity.
“That has in it” rendered from asher-bo; “soul” from nefesh chayyah.
Prepositions (“to,” “upon,” “for”) reflect structural use of לְ and עַל.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Completes the creation provision sequence that began with humans in v.29.
Affirms divine concern for non-human life.
Serves as ethical precedent for later ecological and dietary patterns.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Mirrors language from v.22 (blessing of creatures).
Reinforces “nefesh chayyah” designation as applying to both humans and animals.
Prepares for v.31, where all creation is declared “very good.”
Introduces a shared basis for life-sustaining food across species.
