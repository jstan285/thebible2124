[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

Three categories: beasts of the earth, birds of the sky, creeping things.

Each described as having “nefesh chayyah” (living being/soul).

Food provision = “kol yereq esev” (every green plant).

Closes with fulfillment formula “vayhi-ken.”

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

MT and DSS align.

LXX: “καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς θηρίοις τῆς γῆς καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς πετεινοῖς τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ παντὶ ἑρπετῷ τῷ ἑρπόντι ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, ὃ ἔχει ἐν ἑαυτῷ ψυχὴν ζωῆς, πᾶν χόρτον χλωρὸν εἰς βρῶσιν· καὶ ἐγένετο οὕτως” (“and to all beasts of the earth and all birds of the sky and every creeping thing upon the earth which has in it a living soul: every green herb for food; and it was so”).

Samaritan Pentateuch agrees with MT.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Complements v.29 (food for humans).

Parallels v.22 (blessing of animals) and anticipates 2:19 (naming of animals).

Closes divine provision cycle before climactic evaluation in v.31.
