[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And God saw everything that He had made — and behold, it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning — the sixth day.

[RENDERING NOTES]

Follows standard creation structure: divine seeing + evaluation + temporal close.
“Everything that He had made” marks culmination of prior acts.
“Behold” (hineh) signals climactic emphasis.
“Very good” (tov me’od) is a superlative, unique to this day.
Evening-morning formula echoes prior days, confirming rhythmic pattern.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“That He had made” from “asher asah” — relative clause rendered naturally.
No additions beyond helper articles (“the”) and smoothing connectors (“and”).
Dashes used for pacing and visual clarity, not original structure.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Culmination of Day Six — the end of active creation.
Immediately precedes the rest and blessing of Day Seven.
Echoes all prior “God saw… it was good” judgments, but amplifies with “very.”

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Bookends Genesis 1’s rhythmic cycle: speech → action → evaluation → day close.
“Tov me’od” sets climactic contrast to prior evaluations (“tov”).
Temporal phrase marks time’s division, sustaining theme of cosmic order.
