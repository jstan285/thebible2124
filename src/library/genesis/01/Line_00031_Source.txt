[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

The verse combines divine evaluation, climactic superlative “tov me’od” (very good), and the standard evening-morning refrain.

This is the only day to receive the evaluation “very good.”

Closing formula parallels vv.5, 8, 13, 19, 23, but with heightened finality.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

MT and DSS consistent.

LXX: “καὶ εἶδεν ὁ θεὸς πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν, καὶ ἰδοὺ καλὰ λίαν. καὶ ἐγένετο ἑσπέρα καὶ ἐγένετο πρωί, ἡμέρα ἕκτη” (“and God saw all that he had made, and behold it was very good. And it became evening and it became morning, sixth day”).

Samaritan Pentateuch matches MT.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Concludes Day Six and the entire creation week before the Sabbath rest (2:1–3).

Climactic parallel to vv.4, 10, 12, 18, 21, 25 (“God saw that it was good”).

Establishes completeness: all domains filled, all creatures provided for.
