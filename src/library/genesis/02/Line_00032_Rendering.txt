This isn’t a lesson. It’s a space. Come as you are. Let the line speak to you.

[FILE TAGS]
[LINE ID]: 00032
[BOOK]: Genesis
[CHAPTER]: 2
[VERSE]: 1
[FILE TYPE]: Line Rendering

[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And were completed the heavens and the earth and all their array.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“And were completed” reflects וַיְכֻלּוּ (vaykullu), a vav-consecutive verb in the imperfect Qal form indicating completed action.
“The heavens” renders הַשָּׁמַיִם (hashamayim), a masculine plural noun with definite article.
“The earth” renders וְהָאָרֶץ (veha’aretz), feminine singular with conjunction and definite article.
“And all their array” renders וְכָל־צְבָאָם (vekol-tzeva’am), a construct noun meaning “host” or “assembly,” with a 3rd person masculine plural suffix referring to “the heavens and the earth.”

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

Inserted “and” at the beginning to reflect vav-consecutive on the verb.
Definite articles “the” before “heavens” and “earth” match Hebrew form.
Added “their” to reflect the suffix ם in צְבָאָם (“their array”).
No interpretive smoothing or reordering applied.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

This line concludes the six-day creative sequence and marks a structural shift into rest and sanctification (Genesis 2:2–3).
It functions as a closure to the preceding cosmic formation and an opening to the concept of divine cessation and blessing.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Completes a verbal arc begun in Genesis 1:1 with “the heavens and the earth” as object; this line now shows their finished state.
The phrase “all their array” anticipates heavenly assemblies and ordered multiplicity seen in later texts (e.g., Nehemiah 9:6).

This rendering is provided for orientation only.
It draws from the Line Source File and reflects the structure of the original text as faithfully as possible, while adapting to minimal English phrasing.
