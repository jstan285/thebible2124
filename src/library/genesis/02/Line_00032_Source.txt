[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

The verb “vaykullu” governs a compound subject — “the heavens and the earth and all their host.”
The phrase “kol-tzeva’am” forms a genitive construction indicating all subordinate entities.
The verb is plural, aligning grammatically with the compound plural subject.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

No major deviations recorded in Qumran, SP, or LXX for this verse.
Consistent form in Leningrad Codex and Aleppo Codex (fragmentary support).

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Continuation of “shamayim” and “aretz” pairing from Genesis 1:1, completing the structural arc.
The term “tzeva’am” anticipates similar cosmological assemblies seen in later texts (e.g., Nehemiah 9:6).
