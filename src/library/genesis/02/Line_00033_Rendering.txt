[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And God completed on the seventh day his work that he had made, and he ceased on the seventh day from all his work that he had made.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Completed” renders וַיְכַל (vaykhal), from כלה (kalah), used here in Qal imperfect with vav-consecutive — signifying finalized action.
“On the seventh day” translates בַּיּוֹם הַשְּׁבִיעִי (bayom hashevi‘i), repeated twice for emphasis.
“His work that he had made” translates מְלַאכְתּוֹ אֲשֶׁר עָשָׂה, using construct and perfect verb to denote ownership and completed past action.
“Ceased” reflects וַיִּשְׁבֹּת (vayishbot), from שׁבת (shavat), meaning to rest or stop.
The structure mirrors itself in the repetition of phrasing — “his work that he had made” appears identically in both halves.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“On” inserted for the prepositional בְּ (in/on) before “day.”
“That he had” added to reflect perfect tense and relative clause of אֲשֶׁר עָשָׂה.
Repetition maintained without smoothing.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

This line concludes the active creation sequence and initiates the concept of sacred cessation.
It prepares the theological ground for Sabbath — not as absence of activity, but as fulfillment and rest.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Continues the pattern of divine action followed by completion.
“Melakhto asher asah” (his work that he had made) appears twice — emphasizing totality and closure.
This structure bridges Genesis 1 (creation) and Genesis 2:3 (blessing and sanctification).
