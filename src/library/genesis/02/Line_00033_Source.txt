[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

The verse has two verb clauses with “vav-consecutive” forms: vaykhal and vayishbot, marking sequential actions.
The phrase “melakhto asher asah” is repeated twice, forming a parallel construction.
Definite timing is emphasized by the double use of “bayom hashevi‘i.”
The structure underscores the transition from action to cessation.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

Some manuscript discussions focus on whether “on the seventh day” (בַּיּוֹם הַשְּׁבִיעִי) could be harmonized with later Sabbath theology, but no firm textual variants are present in the Leningrad Codex.
The Samaritan Pentateuch reads "on the sixth day" in the first clause, reflecting interpretive harmonization, but this is not followed in Masoretic tradition.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Continues from Genesis 2:1, concluding the creative cycle.
Echoes the “work” (מְלָאכָה) theme introduced in Genesis 1:31 and sets up the sanctification of the seventh day in Genesis 2:3.
