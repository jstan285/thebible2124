[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it he ceased from all his work that God created to do.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Blessed” reflects וַיְבָרֶךְ (vayevarekh), a Piel vav-consecutive verb meaning to bless or invoke divine favor.
“Sanctified” renders וַיְקַדֵּשׁ (vayqaddesh), also in the Piel stem, meaning to consecrate or set apart as holy.
“Because in it he ceased” translates כִּי בוֹ שָׁבַת (ki vo shavat), with “ki” offering causal explanation.
“From all his work that God created to do” follows the sequence: מִכָּל־מְלַאכְתּוֹ אֲשֶׁר בָּרָא אֱלֹהִים לַעֲשׂוֹת — reflecting both completed action (bara) and ongoing purpose (la’asot).
Repetition of “Elohim” and “work” (melakhto) ties back structurally to Genesis 2:2 and 1:1.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

Definite articles “the” inserted before “seventh day.”
“It” supplied for the object pronoun אֹתוֹ (oto).
“He” added before “ceased” for clarity.
No smoothing applied beyond grammatical readability.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

This line finalizes the creation narrative by framing the seventh day not only as a day of cessation but as one of blessing and sanctification.
It transitions the sequence from action to purpose — from forming to meaning.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Concludes the three-part seventh-day triad: completion (2:1), cessation (2:2), and sanctification (2:3).
The dual verbs “blessed” and “sanctified” mirror liturgical and legal echoes throughout the Torah.
