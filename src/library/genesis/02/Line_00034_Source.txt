[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

The verse contains two key verbal clauses with vav-consecutive form: “vayevarekh” and “vayqaddesh.”
“Ki vo shavat” functions as a causal explanation for the blessing and sanctification.
The infinitive “la’asot” is dependent on the clause “asher bara Elohim,” marking divine intent or potential.
The repetition of “melakhto” and “Elohim” anchors the verse structurally to prior lines.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

No major variants reported in Leningrad Codex or Aleppo Codex.
The Samaritan Pentateuch and LXX both preserve the general structure and vocabulary.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Final clause in the Genesis 1–2:3 creation sequence.
“Shavat” links back to Genesis 2:2 and sets foundation for later Sabbath regulations (e.g., Exodus 20:11).
“Bara” echoes Genesis 1:1 and 1:27, framing creation with identical verb.
