[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

These are the generations of the heavens and the earth in their being created, on the day YHWH God made earth and heavens.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“These are the generations” reflects אֵלֶּה תּוֹלְדוֹת (elleh toledot), a recurring phrase introducing genealogical or narrative sections.
“Of the heavens and the earth” is a standard construct pair; note the definite articles.
“In their being created” renders בְּהִבָּרְאָם (behibbare’am), a Niphal infinitive construct with a 3rd person masculine plural suffix — indicating passive creation of the plural subject.
“On the day” translates בְּיוֹם (beyom), functioning as a temporal marker.
“YHWH God” reflects the full double divine naming: יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים.
“Made earth and heavens” reflects עֲשׂוֹת...אֶרֶץ וְשָׁמָיִם, notably reversing the phrase order from the standard “heavens and earth.”

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“Are” inserted for grammatical flow in English.
“Their” added to reflect 3rd person suffix on “being created.”
“The” added before “heavens” and “earth” where definite article is present.
“God” added after “YHWH” to represent dual name.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

This line closes the first creation narrative and introduces the next.
Serves as a hinge verse — summarizing the cosmos’ origin and reframing the narrative lens toward human-centered formation.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Mirrors Genesis 1:1 but reverses the phrase order (“earth and heavens”).
The formula “elleh toledot” initiates a literary structure used throughout Genesis (e.g., Gen 5:1, 6:9).
