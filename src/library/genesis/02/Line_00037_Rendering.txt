[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

But a mist would rise from the earth and water all the surface of the ground.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“But” reflects the vav at the beginning of וְאֵד (ve’ed), offering narrative contrast to the previous absence in 2:5.
“A mist” renders אֵד (ed), which can mean vapor, exhalation, or stream — selected here as “mist” to maintain subtle emergence.
“Would rise” reflects יַעֲלֶה (ya‘aleh), Qal imperfect, indicating ongoing or habitual action — a rising motion from below.
“From the earth” is מִן־הָאָרֶץ (min-ha’aretz), with clear directional flow.
“Water” reflects וְהִשְׁקָה (vehishqah), Hiphil perfect with vav-consecutive — causative action: to moisten or irrigate.
“All the surface of the ground” translates אֶת־כָּל־פְּנֵי הָאֲדָמָה — a totalizing phrase describing the full terrain, with “face” (penei) used idiomatically.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“But” inserted to reflect narrative contrast.
“Would” added for imperfective aspect in “would rise.”
“The” added in “the surface of the ground” for clarity.
No interpretive smoothing or metaphoric language used.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Offers an alternative to rain — an emergent source of moisture preceding cultivation and human action.
Resolves the environmental tension posed in Genesis 2:5 with an unexpected mechanism.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Follows a narrative pattern of problem/resolution: no rain/no man (2:5) → mist rising (2:6) → human formed (2:7).
Completes a fluid triad preparing the conditions of Eden.
