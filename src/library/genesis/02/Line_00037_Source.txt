[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

The sentence contains two main clauses joined by vav-consecutive.
“Ya‘aleh” and “vehishqah” follow sequential verbal logic: rising followed by watering.
“Et kol-penei ha’adamah” is the direct object of “vehishqah,” marking the totality of land surface.

No known variants in major textual witnesses for this line.
Confirmed in Leningrad Codex, Aleppo (where extant), and consistent with Masoretic tradition.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Continues the logical flow from Genesis 2:5 where no rain or cultivation had yet occurred.
Anticipates formation of the human from the “adamah” in Genesis 2:7.
