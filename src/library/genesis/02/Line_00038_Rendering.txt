[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And YHWH God formed the human from dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the human became a living being.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Formed” renders וַיִּיצֶר (vayyitzer), Qal imperfect with vav-consecutive, suggesting completed, intentional action.
“The human” for הָאָדָם (ha’adam), matching the definite article and reflecting the archetypal rather than named individual.
“Dust of the ground” reflects עָפָר מִן־הָאֲדָמָה (afar min-ha’adamah), preserving the adam–adamah wordplay.
“Breathed into his nostrils” translates וַיִּפַּח בְּאַפָּיו (vayyipach be’apav), with direct object “the breath of life” (נִשְׁמַת חַיִּים, nishmat chayyim).
“Became a living being” for וַיְהִי לְנֶפֶשׁ חַיָּה (vayhi lenephesh chayyah), an idiom signifying transformation into animate life.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“The” inserted before “human” and “ground” to reflect definite articles.
“Of” inserted to clarify construct chain “dust of the ground.”
“Into” and “a” added for readability in English.
All phrases directly traceable to the structure and lexemes in the Line Source File.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

This is the climactic creation moment for humanity — formed physically from soil, activated by divine breath.
The line serves as a fulcrum between environmental preparation (2:5–6) and the human’s placement in Eden (2:8).
Introduces foundational anthropological themes: embodiment, divine origin, breath-life.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Structured as three movement clauses: form (physical), breathe (spiritual), become (ontological state).
Wordplay: adam–adamah; chayyim–chayyah.
Verb sequence binds divine action to transformation of material into living nephesh.
