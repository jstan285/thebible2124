[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And YHWH God planted a garden in Eden, from the east, and there he placed the human whom he had formed.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Planted” renders וַיִּטַּע (vayyitta), Qal imperfect with vav-consecutive — deliberate, creative action.
“A garden in Eden” translates גַּן־בְּעֵדֶן (gan-be‘eden) — not yet a proper name but a location descriptor.
“From the east” renders מִקֶּדֶם (miqqedem), which also connotes “from ancient time” or “from before” — spatial and/or temporal.
“He placed” is וַיָּשֶׂם (vayyasem), second vav-consecutive verb — signals intentional positioning.
“The human whom he had formed” retains the relative clause אֶת־הָאָדָם אֲשֶׁר יָצָר (et-ha’adam asher yatzar), connecting back to 2:7.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“A” before “garden” added for clarity.
“There” added for smoother English rendering of שָׁם (sham).
“Whom he had” supplies English grammar for the relative verb clause.
All content traceable directly to original phrasing; no interpretive smoothing applied.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Follows directly after the formation of the human — shows divine placement, not random existence.
Introduces the Garden of Eden as a created space for habitation and cultivation.
Builds the environment for the human–divine relational story to unfold.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Two action verbs in sequence: “planted” and “placed.”
Eden functions as both noun and concept — location of delight and origin.
Echo of human intentionality: “whom he had formed” (asher yatzar) connects to divine design.
Opens the spatial dimension of the Eden narrative cycle.
