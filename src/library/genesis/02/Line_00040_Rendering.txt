[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And YHWH God caused to grow from the ground every tree desirable in appearance and good for food — and the tree of life in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Caused to grow” renders וַיַּצְמַח (vayyatzmach), Hiphil imperfect with vav-consecutive — divine initiator of emergence.
“From the ground” (מִן־הָאֲדָמָה, min-ha’adamah) links to human origin in 2:7, reinforcing shared source.
“Every tree desirable in appearance and good for food” follows the structure כָּל־עֵץ נֶחְמָד לְמַרְאֶה וְטוֹב לְמַאֲכָל — descriptive pairing of beauty and function.
“The tree of life... the tree of the knowledge of good and evil” are rendered as direct phrases, retaining conjunction structure and definite articles.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“And” added between list elements for English readability.
“Of” inserted to reflect genitive constructions in “tree of life,” “tree of knowledge.”
Em dashes and list breaks used for clarity, not original punctuation.
All phrasing traceable to word-for-word lexical structure.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Expands the Eden environment introduced in 2:8 — describing its organic fullness and moral-symbolic centerpieces.
Establishes thematic anchors: life, knowledge, appearance, sustenance.
Prepares for ethical instruction (2:16–17) and narrative tension (Genesis 3).

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Tripartite unfolding: general tree description → tree of life → tree of knowledge.
Balances aesthetic (“desirable in appearance”) with practical (“good for food”).
“Tov vara” (good and evil) introduces moral duality language not yet activated.
