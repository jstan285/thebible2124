[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

The verse describes growth initiated by the divine through Hiphil causation (“vayyatzmach”).
Uses a list structure: general trees → tree of life → tree of knowledge.
“Tov vara” is a binary pair often used in Hebrew to denote moral or experiential totality.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

No major variant readings in the Masoretic tradition.
Structure consistent in Leningrad and Aleppo codices.
Septuagint reorders some descriptive phrases, but base nouns are identical.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Follows directly from the placement of “ha’adam” in the garden (2:8).
Introduces themes and trees that will recur prominently in Genesis 2:16–17 and chapter 3.
