[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And a river flows out from Eden to water the garden, and from there it separates and becomes four heads.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Flows out” translates יֹצֵא (yotze), a Qal participle indicating ongoing movement.
“From Eden” (מֵעֵדֶן, me‘eden) connects the water source with the origin-place of delight and cultivation.
“To water the garden” renders לְהַשְׁקוֹת אֶת־הַגָּן (lehashqot et-hagan), Hiphil infinitive construct for irrigation or sustenance.
“Separates” renders יִפָּרֵד (yippared), Niphal imperfect — a passive branching.
“Becomes four heads” uses וְהָיָה לְאַרְבָּעָה רָאשִׁים (vehayah le’arba‘ah rashim) — results in four sources or branches.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“And” added for sequential connection.
“It” before “separates” added for English grammar; subject implied in Hebrew.
All verbs and nouns are directly traceable; no smoothing or interpretive insertions made.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Builds the ecosystem introduced in verses 8–9 by adding irrigation flow.
Initiates movement outward from Eden — first fluid dynamism in the narrative.
Sets up geographic and symbolic expansion via the four rivers named in 2:11–14.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Structure: origin (Eden) → purpose (water garden) → consequence (branch into four).
Syntactic sequence models flow: participle (yotze) → infinitive (lehashqot) → imperfect (yippared) → perfect (vehayah).
Introduces multiplicity from unity — singular river divides into plural “heads.”
