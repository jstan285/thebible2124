[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

The sentence is composed of a main clause (“a river goes out”) followed by purpose (“to water the garden”) and result (“was divided into four heads”).
Verbs shift from participial (“yotze”) to finite forms (“yippared,” “vehayah”), indicating flow-to-division sequence.
“Rashim” as “heads” can signify both geographic source points or primary channels.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

No major variants in the Masoretic tradition; phrase structure stable across major witnesses.
Septuagint renders “heads” as “ἀρχάς” (archas), consistent with “sources” or “beginnings.”

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Introduces the branching rivers that will be named in Genesis 2:11–14.
Reinforces Eden as a geographic and life-giving source.
Continues motif of abundance initiated in Genesis 2:9.
