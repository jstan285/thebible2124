[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

The name of the first river is Pishon — it encircles the whole land of Havilah, where there is bdellium, blossom, and onyx.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“The name of the first river” renders שְׁמוֹ הַנָּהָר הָרִאשׁוֹן (shem hanahar harishon) with possessive construction.
“Is Pishon” reflects simple noun equivalence with פִּישׁוֹן (Pishon).
“It encircles” comes from הַסּוֹבֵב (hassovev), a participle form of סבב (savav).
“The whole land of Havilah” uses כָּל־אֶרֶץ־חֲוִילָה (kol-erets-Chavila), combining totality and geographic naming.
“Where there is” derives from אֲשֶׁר שָׁם (asher sham), a relative clause.
“Bdellium, blossom, and onyx” groups הָאוֹנִיק פֶּרֶחַ אוֹב as a triad — all precious or aesthetically significant substances.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

Em dash inserted to break list for clarity; not in original.
“There is” implied by context of אֲשֶׁר שָׁם; included for readability.
All listed nouns traceable directly to source line; no interpretive additions.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

First of four rivers stemming from Eden (see 2:10).
Connects geography with resource wealth — both mineral and aesthetic.
Launches the regional mapping of the Edenic outflow.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Pattern: Name → Function → Region → Feature
This structure repeats in upcoming verses for the other rivers.
Use of relative clause (“where there is…”) parallels 2:12's mineral detail.
