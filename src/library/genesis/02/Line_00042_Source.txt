[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

Begins with a possessive clause: "shem‑o hanahar harishon Pishon" — naming the first river.
Follows with existential/locative participle: "hu hassovev et kol‑erets‑Chavila."
"Asher sham" introduces relative location.
Two substances “ha‑‘onikh perakh‑ov” are listed with parallel structure for description.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

Masoretic tradition is stable here; no substantial textual variants known.
Septuagint retains similar phrasing and preserves Pishon and Havilah names.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Part of the Edenic river-naming series (preceded by 2:10; followed by 2:12–14).
Details the first river and region — provides context for subsequent mineral mention in 2:12 and naming of the Gihon river in 2:13.
