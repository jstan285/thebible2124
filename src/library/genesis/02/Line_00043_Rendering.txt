This isn’t a lesson. It’s a space. Come as you are. Let the line speak to you.

[FILE TAGS]
[LINE ID]: 00043
[BOOK]: Genesis
[CHAPTER]: 2

[FILE TYPE]: Line Rendering

[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And the gold of that land is good — there is bdellium and onyx stone there.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“And the gold of that land” renders וּזֲהַב הָאָרֶץ הַהִוא (uzahav ha’aretz hahi), with the conjunction + definite noun + demonstrative.
“Is good” reflects טוֹב (tov), standing independently as a value judgment.
“There is bdellium and onyx” reflects שָׁם הַבְּדֹלַח וְאֶבֶן הַשֹּׁהַם (sham habdolach ve’even hashoham), maintaining noun listing structure.
All items are presented as locational — “there” occurs twice in Hebrew for poetic emphasis.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“Is” supplied in “is good” for English grammar; not explicitly present in Hebrew.
Second “there” inserted in final phrase for English balance and clarity.
“Stone” after “onyx” is interpretive clarification of אֶבֶן (even) — traceable but added for clarity.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Continues description of the land of Havilah (introduced in v.11).
Confirms its resources and quality, enriching Edenic river narrative.
First direct evaluation of land materials in the narrative — “good.”

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Syntactic flow: noun clause → evaluative adjective → locational substance list.
Links directly to prior verse thematically and lexically (see "bdellium").
Emphasizes triad of resources across verses 11–12: bdellium, blossom, onyx → gold, bdellium, onyx.
