[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

The verse continues a descriptive elaboration of the land associated with the first of the four rivers (Pishon, v.11).
“Zahav ha’aretz hahi” forms a noun clause with demonstrative.
“Tov” functions independently as an evaluative adjective.
The list structure — gold, bdellium, and onyx — follows “sham,” indicating locality.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

No major variants recorded in the Masoretic tradition.
Septuagint offers τὸ χρυσίον…καὶ λίθος πράσινος (“gold... and green stone”), supporting shoham as gemstone.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Expands on the description of the land of Havilah (Genesis 2:11).
Continues the river narrative (Genesis 2:10–14) and Edenic abundance motif.
Lexical connection between “tov” here and “tov” in Genesis 1 (e.g., 1:4, 1:10).
