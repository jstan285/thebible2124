[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And the name of the second river is Gihon — it encircles all the land of Cush.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“And the name of the second river” renders וְשֵׁם־הַנָּהָר הַשֵּׁנִי (veshem-hanahar hasheni), a direct naming formula.
“Is Gihon” reflects apposition with גִּיחוֹן (Gichon) and pronoun הוּא (hu), typical of identification clauses.
“It encircles” derives from the participial הַסּוֹבֵב (hassovev), emphasizing ongoing or habitual action.
“All the land of Cush” renders אֵת כָּל־אֶרֶץ כּוּשׁ (et kol-eretz Kush) with direct object marker and geographic specificity.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

Em dash inserted for English pacing; not in original.
“Is” supplied for readability in “is Gihon.”
“It” inferred for subject continuity in “it encircles.”
No other insertions or interpretive flourishes.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Continues the sequence of four Eden rivers (see v.10–12).
Expands sacred geography beyond Eden proper.
Cush later appears in biblical history as a notable southern region.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Mirrors 2:11 in structure: river name → function → geography.
Participle use (“encircling”) maintains stylistic continuity.
Sets up spatial dynamics of Edenic river outflow — one center, multiple flows.
