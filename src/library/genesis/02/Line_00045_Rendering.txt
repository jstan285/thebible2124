[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And the name of the third river is Chiddeqel — it is the one flowing eastward of Assyria. And the fourth river is Perat.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“And the name of the third river” renders וְשֵׁם הַנָּהָר הַשְּׁלִישִׁי (veshem hanahar hashlishi).
“Chiddeqel” is preserved untranslated as the river’s proper name.
“It is the one flowing eastward of Assyria” reflects הוּא הַהֹלֵךְ קִדְמַת אַשּׁוּר (hu haholekh qidmat Ashur).
“And the fourth river is Perat” renders וְהַנָּהָר הָרְבִיעִי הוּא פְרָת (vehanahar harevi‘i hu Perat), a full naming and identification clause.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“Is” inserted for standard English syntax.
“The one” in “the one flowing” draws from participial structure; not a direct lexical term.
No smoothing or interpretive phrases beyond traceable equivalents.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Completes the Edenic four-river system introduced in 2:10.
Chiddeqel and Perat correspond to known geographical rivers: Tigris and Euphrates.
Ashur (Assyria) establishes the verse within later geopolitical consciousness.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

The dual-phrase structure (third + fourth river) closes the narrative cycle begun in v.10.
Use of “hu” for both clauses unites identity with directional or nominal predicate.
Geographic expansion from Eden proper to regional landmarks (Assyria, Euphrates).
