[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

Two clauses of parallel form: each names a river, gives its ordinal rank, adds a proper noun identifier, and a brief descriptor.
"Hu haholekh" and "hu Perat" serve as predicate constructions.
“Qidmat Ashur” is a compound directional phrase: "eastward of Ashur."

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

Masoretic witnesses are unified in structure and naming.
Septuagint renders Χεδέκλ and Εὐφράτης for Chiddeqel and Perat respectively.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Completes the fourfold river structure initiated in Genesis 2:10.
All four rivers now named: Pishon, Gihon, Chiddeqel (Tigris), and Perat (Euphrates).
Connects to broader biblical geography (e.g., Assyria, future narratives in Genesis and beyond).
