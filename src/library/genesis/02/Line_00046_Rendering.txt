[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And YHWH God took the human and placed him in the garden of Eden to serve it and to guard it.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“And YHWH God took” renders וַיִּקַּח יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים (vayyiqqach YHWH Elohim), combining divine subject with vav-consecutive verb.
“The human” translates אֶת־הָאָדָם (et-ha’adam), marked as the direct object.
“And placed him” comes from וַיַּנִּחֵהוּ (vayyannihehu), causative verb form.
“In the garden of Eden” (בְּגַן־עֵדֶן, began-‘eden) is a prepositional placement.
“To serve it and to guard it” reflects the infinitive pair לְעָבְדָהּ וּלְשָׁמְרָהּ (le‘ovdah uleshomerah), with final feminine suffixes referring to “garden.”

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“And” supplied where vav-consecutive verbs occur.
“It” in “serve it” and “guard it” corresponds to suffixes — no addition.
“The” added for English flow (“the human,” “the garden”).
No other insertions or interpretive smoothing.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Follows the Eden planting and river sequencing of v.8–14.
Introduces human vocation within the sacred space.
First explicit declaration of human responsibility.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Balanced structure: divine action → human subject → sacred location → dual purpose.
Root verbs (עבד, שׁמר) echo throughout Torah in both cultic and ethical commands.
Garden as both gift and trust.
