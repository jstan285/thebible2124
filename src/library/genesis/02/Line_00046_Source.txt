[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

The verse contains two sequential actions: “vayyiqqach” and “vayyannihehu,” forming a divine subject with a direct object.
The infinitive constructs “le‘ovdah” and “uleshomerah” form a purpose/result clause — purpose of the placement.
The 3fs suffixes on both infinitives refer grammatically to “gan” (garden), a masculine noun treated as feminine in construct.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

No major variants recorded in Masoretic tradition.
Septuagint reflects similar structure with infinitives translated into Greek purpose clauses.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Continues the Eden narrative after Genesis 2:8–14.
Reinforces the unique relationship between the human and the cultivated space.
Forms the vocational foundation for later commandments and work/rest paradigms.
