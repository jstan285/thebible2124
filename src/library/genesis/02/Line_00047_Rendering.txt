[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And YHWH God commanded the human, saying: “From every tree of the garden, you may surely eat.”

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Commanded” reflects וַיְצַו (vaytzav), Piel stem with emphatic nuance.
“The human” translates הָאָדָם (ha’adam), definite singular.
“Saying” renders לֵאמֹר (lemor), introducing direct divine speech.
“From every tree of the garden” comes from מִכֹּל עֵץ־הַגָּן (mikol etz-hagan), indicating abundance.
“You may surely eat” translates the emphatic Hebrew structure אָכֹל תֹּאכֵל (akhol to’khel), combining infinitive absolute and imperfect verb to intensify allowance.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“You may surely” inserted to represent emphatic verb construction.
Quotation marks used for clarity in presenting direct speech.
“Of the” added for standard English readability — traceable to definite article on “garden.”
No other additions or interpretive smoothing.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Initiates the divine instruction sequence, immediately preceding the prohibition in v.17.
Establishes a tone of generous permission and trust.
Builds from the vocational placement in v.15 — now transitioning from presence to directive.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Clear divine speech marker (“lemor”) links this to other moments of instruction and covenant.
Use of infinitive absolute + imperfect verb (akhol to’khel) anchors the idea of divine emphasis in Hebrew rhetoric.
Complements but sets up contrast with the next verse’s “but from…” structure.
