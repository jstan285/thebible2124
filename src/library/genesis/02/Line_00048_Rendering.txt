[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

But from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat from it, for in the day you eat from it, dying you shall die.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“But from the tree…” renders the prepositional phrase וּמֵעֵץ (ume‘etz) with contrast to prior verse.
“The knowledge of good and evil” follows הַדַּעַת טוֹב וָרָע (hadda‘at tov vara), combining feminine noun with masculine adjectives.
“You shall not eat” translates לֹא תֹאכַל (lo to’khal), standard negated imperfect form.
Repetition of מִמֶּנּוּ (mimennu) — “from it” — frames both instruction and consequence.
“For in the day you eat…” reflects כִּי בְּיוֹם אֲכָלְךָ (ki beyom akholkha) — causal/temporal clause.
“Dying you shall die” is the emphatic Hebrew idiom מוֹת תָּמוּת (mot tamut) — infinitive absolute + imperfect verb.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“But” inserted for contrastive sense, implied by context though not grammatically marked.
Repeated “from it” preserved as in original Hebrew structure.
No smoothing or omissions applied.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

This line completes the divine command that begins in 2:16.
Moves from permissive abundance to singular boundary.
Establishes a sacred limit that becomes central to the unfolding Eden narrative.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Direct inversion of the permission formula in v.16 — akhol to’khel vs. lo to’khal.
Structural layering:
• Instruction → Object → Consequence
• Contrast within divine voice — invitation then warning.

[CAUTIONARY REMINDER]
This rendering is provided for orientation only.
It draws from the Line Source File and reflects the structure of the original text as faithfully as possible, while adapting to minimal English phrasing.
Interpretive meaning is not asserted. For lexical and grammatical details, consult the Line Source File.
