[INTRO]

It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And YHWH God said: “It is not good for the human to be alone. I will make for him a helper corresponding to him.”

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Said” renders וַיֹּאמֶר (vayomer), Qal imperfect with vav-consecutive.
“It is not good” is a direct translation of לֹא־טוֹב (lo-tov), forming a negative evaluative clause.
“The human” follows הָאָדָם (ha’adam), definite noun.
“To be alone” = הֱיוֹת לְבַדּוֹ (heyot levado), infinitive construct with prepositional phrase “by himself.”
“I will make for him” is אֶֽעֱשֶׂה־לּוֹ (e‘eseh-lo), Qal imperfect first person + preposition.
“A helper corresponding to him” comes from עֵזֶר כְּנֶגְדּוֹ (‘ezer kenegdo), conveying alignment, not subordination.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

Quotation marks added for clarity around divine speech.
“It is” inserted for standard English evaluative clause.
“For him” and “to be” derive directly from construct phrases in Hebrew.
No conceptual smoothing introduced.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Follows the singular placement of the human in Eden (2:15–17).
Introduces divine observation and intention for relational design.
Marks the first “not good” in the Genesis creation sequence.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

“Vayomer YHWH Elohim” aligns with other divine speech acts.
Juxtaposes prior “good” evaluations with this unique “not good” pronouncement.
The phrase “helper corresponding to him” is unique in Hebrew, guiding interpretation of future verses.
