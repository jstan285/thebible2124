[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

The sentence opens with a divine declaration (“vayomer YHWH Elohim”).
The phrase “lo-tov heyot ha’adam levado” is a negative evaluative clause.
“E‘eseh-lo ‘ezer kenegdo” functions as the divine resolve and solution.
“Kenegdo” is unique and structurally complex — connoting alignment and correspondence.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

Masoretic tradition is stable.
Septuagint reflects: "ποιήσω αὐτῷ βοηθὸν κατ᾽ αὐτόν" — confirming correspondence theme.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Responds directly to the preceding isolation of the human in Genesis 2:15–17.
Prepares for the sequence of creation in Genesis 2:19–22.
Anchors the Eden narrative in relational design, preceding the naming of animals.
