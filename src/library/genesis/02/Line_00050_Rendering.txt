[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And YHWH God formed from the ground every animal of the field and every bird of the skies. And he brought them to the human to see what he would call them. And whatever the human called it — a living being — that was its name.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Formed” reflects וַיִּצֶר (vayyitzer), Qal imperfect with vav-consecutive.
“From the ground” renders מִן־הָאֲדָמָה (min-ha’adamah), indicating shared origin with the human.
“Every animal of the field” and “every bird of the skies” translate construct phrases (כָּל־חַיַּת הַשָּׂדֶה ... כָּל־עוֹף הַשָּׁמַיִם).
“To see what he would call them” = infinitive + interrogative clause, לִרְאוֹת מַה־יִּקְרָא־לוֹ.
“Whatever the human called it — a living being” echoes structural designation: וְכֹל אֲשֶׁר יִקְרָא־לוֹ הָאָדָם נֶפֶשׁ חַיָּה.
“That was its name” = הוּא שְׁמוֹ (hu shemo), 3ms pronoun + possessive.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“Them” is implicit in Hebrew plural context.
Em-dash used to mark embedded phrase “a living being.”
No conceptual smoothing added.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Continues divine movement from observation (v.18) to action (v.19).
Frames the human as naming agent within creation.
Sets up the recognition of non-correspondence in v.20.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Verb chain structure with sequential vav-consecutives.
Naming emphasized as act of discernment and designation.
Thematic link to previous line: “not good... alone” now tested through relational interaction.
