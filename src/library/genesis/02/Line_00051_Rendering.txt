[BOOK]: Genesis
[CHAPTER]: 2

[FILE TYPE]: Line Rendering

[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And the human called names for all the animals, and for the bird of the skies, and for every creature of the field. But for the human, no helper corresponding to him was found.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Called” renders וַיִּקְרָא (vayiqra), Qal imperfect with vav-consecutive — an initiating narrative verb.
“Names” = שֵׁמוֹת (shemot), plural form of “name.”
“To all the animals” = לְכָל־הַבְּהֵמָה (le’khol-habehemah), definite construct form.
“Bird of the skies” = עוֹף הַשָּׁמַיִם (‘of hashamayim), construct phrase.
“Creature of the field” = חַיַּת הַשָּׂדֶה (chayat hasadeh), feminine singular construct + definite noun.
“No helper corresponding to him” = לֹא־מָצָא עֵזֶר כְּנֶגְדּוֹ (lo-matza ‘ezer kenegdo), definitive statement in Qal perfect.
“Kenegdo” implies alignment or counterpart, not subordination.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“For” added repeatedly to match construct syntax in English.
“But” added to mark logical contrast in second clause.
No conceptual smoothing beyond explicit structure.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Immediate continuation of Genesis 2:19 — following the divine presentation of animals to the human.
Concludes the testing sequence for relational fit.
Sets up the divine resolution to follow in vv.21–22.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Phrase “no helper corresponding to him was found” parallels v.18, closing the thematic loop.
Lexical and narrative repetition underscore insufficiency of animals to meet the human’s relational need.
Balances naming authority with existential lack.
