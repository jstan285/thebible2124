[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

The line contains two major clauses:

Naming action performed by the human upon animals.

Conclusive statement of absence regarding a fitting helper.

The phrasing “kenegdo” parallels Genesis 2:18.
“Lo matza” is past tense and definitive.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

Masoretic reading consistent.
Septuagint parallels “οὐχ εὑρέθη βοηθὸς ὅμοιος αὐτῷ” — “no helper was found like to him.”

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Immediate continuation of Genesis 2:19 — same sequence.
Precedes divine action in Genesis 2:21–22 to resolve the helper absence.
Reinforces distinctiveness and insufficiency of animal creation for relational counterpart.
