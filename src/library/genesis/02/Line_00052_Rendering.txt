[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And YHWH God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the human, and he slept. And he took one from his sides, and closed up flesh in its place.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Caused to fall” = וַיַּפֵּל (vayyapel), Hiphil imperfect with vav-consecutive — causative action.
“Deep sleep” = תַּרְדֵּמָה (tardemah), rare word indicating trance-like unconsciousness.
“The human” = הָאָדָם (ha’adam), as earlier.
“He slept” = וַיֵּשַׁן (vayyishan), Qal imperfect, narrative continuation.
“Took one from his sides” = אַחַת מִצַּלְעֹתָיו (achat mitzaltotav), literally “one of his ribs/sides.”
“Closed up flesh in its place” = וַיִּסְגֹּר בָּשָׂר תַּחְתֶּנָּה (vayisgor basar takhtenah) — sealed with flesh beneath it.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“To fall” added for clarity with Hiphil verb.
“In its place” = interpretive trace of תַּחְתֶּנָּה (“under her / instead of it”).
“Sides” used for צַּלְעֹתָיו (tsaltotav) to keep open the rib/beam/side range.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Direct divine response to lack of counterpart from v.20.
Describes initiation of a new act of formation, preceding the emergence of woman.
Divine agency, human passivity — reversal of prior naming acts.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Verb sequence: cause → sleep → take → close.
Clear narrative arc with surgical and mysterious rhythm.
The only “deep sleep” in Genesis — marked moment of creative rupture.
