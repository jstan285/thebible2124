[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And YHWH God built the side that he took from the human into a woman, and brought her to the human.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Built” renders וַיִּבֶן (vayiven), Qal imperfect with vav-consecutive — used for constructing, not forming.
“The side” = הַצֵּלָע (hatsela), feminine singular with definite article — rib/side/beam.
“That he took” = אֲשֶׁר לָקַח (asher laqach), relative clause.
“From the human” = מִן־הָאָדָם (min-ha’adam), prepositional phrase.
“Into a woman” = לְאִשָּׁה (le’ishah), preposition + noun, signaling transformation or purpose.
“Brought her” = וַיְבִאֶהָ (vayevieha), Hiphil imperfect with 3fs suffix — causative movement.
“To the human” = אֶל־הָאָדָם (el-ha’adam), directional phrasing.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“Into” used to render לְ (le’) in a sense of transformation.
“Her” is grammatically present in the Hebrew (3fs suffix).
No smoothing; sequence maintained exactly.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Immediately follows the divine act of extraction (v.21).
Completes the transformation arc: side → woman.
Sets stage for human recognition in v.23.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Continuity of subject (YHWH God) and object (the side → woman).
Action arc: build → bring.
Brings narrative closure to the problem raised in v.18 and restated in v.20.
