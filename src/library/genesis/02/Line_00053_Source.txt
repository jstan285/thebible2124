[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

“Vayiven” marks divine construction — distinctive verb differing from “yatsar” or “asah.”
“Et-hatsela” is marked by direct object indicator, linking the prior rib to a new form.
“Le’ishah” denotes purpose or function in the transformation.
“Vayevieha el-ha’adam” establishes presentation dynamic — movement from divine crafting to human encounter.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

Masoretic reading consistent.
Septuagint renders “κατεσκεύασεν… εἰς γυναῖκα” (he fashioned… into a woman), reflecting similar transformation concept.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Fulfills the resolution of Genesis 2:20.
Directly follows divine action begun in Genesis 2:21.
Precedes the naming of woman in Genesis 2:23.
