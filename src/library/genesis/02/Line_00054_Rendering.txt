[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And the human said, “This time — bone from my bones and flesh from my flesh. To this one shall be called woman, for from man she was taken.”

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Said” = וַיֹּאמֶר (vayomer), Qal imperfect, narrative continuation.
“This time” = הַפַּעַם (happa‘am), definite noun + article — a marked occasion.
“Bone from my bones” and “flesh from my flesh” = parallel poetic structures.
“Shall be called” = יִקָּרֵא (yiqqare’), Niphal imperfect — passive, naming beyond the speaker’s agency.
“Woman” = אִשָּׁה (ishah), root wordplay with “man” (ish).
“Because from man she was taken” = כִּי מֵאִישׁ לֻקֳחָה זֹאת (ki me’ish luqqachah zot), cause and identity.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

Quotation marks used for clarity — a direct speech line.
“This time” used for זֹאת הַפַּעַם (zot happa‘am).
“To this one” = לְזֹאת (le’zot), maintaining feminine demonstrative.
“Shall be called” — passive future rendered without smoothing.
No smoothing or helper verbs beyond structural traceability.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

First recorded human speech in Genesis.
Response to divine presentation in v.22.
Culmination of the human’s search for corresponding being (vv.18–22).
Naming emerges as poetic recognition rather than exerted dominion.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Speech marked by chiastic and parallel forms.
Final clause links identity and origin — ishah from ish.
Contrast to naming of animals (v.20) — here, naming is recognition of shared substance.
