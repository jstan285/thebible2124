[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

Therefore, a man will leave his father and his mother, and he will cling to his wife, and they will become one flesh.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Therefore” = עַל־כֵּן (al-ken), causal connector from preceding verse.
“Will leave” = יַעֲזָב (ya‘azov), Qal imperfect — general/habitual future.
“His father… his mother” = definite objects marked by אֶת and suffixes.
“Will cling” = וְדָבַק (vedavaq), Qal perfect with vav-consecutive nuance — strong bonding.
“His wife” = בְּאִשְׁתּוֹ (be’ishto), prepositional phrase with suffix.
“They will become” = וְהָיוּ (vehayu), Qal perfect plural — joint transformation.
“One flesh” = לְבָשָׂר אֶחָד (lebasar echad), singular noun with numeral — fused unity.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“Therefore” accurately reflects al-ken’s causal function.
No helper words or smoothing beyond structural clarity.
Retains original subject-verb-object progression.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Direct consequence of the prior poetic recognition (v.23).
Shifts from narrative to archetype — prescriptive in tone.
Introduces core pattern of partnership in biblical anthropology.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Transition from speech (v.23) to general principle.
Subject moves from “the human” to “a man” — individual becomes exemplary.
Flow: Leave → Cling → Become — relational trajectory embedded in structure.
