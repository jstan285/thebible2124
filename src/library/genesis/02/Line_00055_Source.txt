[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

“Al-ken” signals causality, linking this verse to the preceding action.
Verb “ya‘azov” is imperfect, indicating future or general habitual action.
“Vedavaq be’ishto” conveys strong attachment, often physical and relational.
“Vehayu lebasar echad” is a verbless clause expressing unity, grammatically plural-to-singular transition.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

Masoretic reading consistent.
Septuagint parallels: “ἕνεκεν τούτου καταλείψει ἄνθρωπος…” and affirms unity expression with “εἰς σάρκα μίαν”.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Interpretive conclusion following Genesis 2:23’s naming of the woman.
Functions as a paradigmatic statement on relational unity.
Often referenced in New Testament texts (e.g., Matthew 19:5; Ephesians 5:31).
