Contemplative Summary

Therefore, a man will leave his father and his mother, and he will cling to his wife, and they will become one flesh.

The story turns from moment into pattern — from recognition to rhythm. The Hebrew al-ken, “for this reason,” bridges revelation and response: what was seen in the first union becomes the archetype for all that follows. The movement unfolds in three verbs — ya‘azov, vedavaq, vehayu — leaving, cleaving, becoming. To leave is to release the field of origin; to cling is to enter the gravity of another; to become is to let both dissolve into shared being. Each step deepens freedom into belonging.

The phrase lebasar echad, “one flesh,” hums with mystery — not sameness, but coherence. Flesh, basar, is the language of embodiment, the place where spirit takes form. Oneness here is not an erasure of difference but a resonance so complete that two lives sound as one. The divine intention echoes: relationship as creation renewed, wholeness rediscovered through union.

To contemplate this line is to hear the quiet wisdom beneath its form — that every true joining requires a leaving, that love is a movement of becoming through release. What if “one flesh” is not the merging of bodies alone, but the recognition that life itself is relational — each self completing its circle through another, until unity finds its voice again?
