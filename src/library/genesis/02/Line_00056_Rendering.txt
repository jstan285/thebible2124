[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And the two of them were naked — the human and his wife — and they were not ashamed.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“And they were” = וַיִּהְיוּ (vayihyu), Qal imperfect plural with vav-consecutive — simple state-of-being.
“The two of them” = שְׁנֵיהֶם (shenehem), dual construct with 3mp suffix — emphasizes the pair.
“Naked” = עֲרוּמִּים (‘arummim), plural adjective — bare or exposed.
“The human and his wife” = הָאָדָם וְאִשְׁתּוֹ (ha’adam ve’ishto) — singular subjects reaffirmed as the plural antecedent.
“And they were not ashamed” = וְלֹא יִתְבֹּשָׁשׁוּ (velo yitboshasu), Hitpael imperfect — no mutual or internal shame response.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

Em-dash added for clarity between subject clarification and the verb clause.
No smoothing or additional verbs.
“Ashamed” chosen for יִתְבֹּשָׁשׁוּ — primary reflexive meaning retained.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Culminating statement of the Genesis 2 creation narrative.
Final condition before the introduction of the serpent and shame in Genesis 3.
Marks a moment of unguarded being — a shared state of presence.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

“The two of them” aligns with the singular pair just described — a unity-in-plurality.
Reflexive verb form suggests emotional mutuality.
Notably concise, yet layered — placement before the Fall magnifies its narrative weight.
