[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

“Vayihyu shenehem” is a plural subject-verb pair, establishing state of being.
“‘Arummim” serves as predicate adjective describing both subjects.
“Ve’ishto” clarifies the pair of “shenehem” — man and his wife.
“Yitboshasu” is reflexive (Hitpael) — internal or mutual emotional response.

Masoretic text stable.
Septuagint reflects similar structure with “ἦσαν δὲ ἀμφότεροι γυμνοί... καὶ οὐκ ᾐσχύνοντο.”
