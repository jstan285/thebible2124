And the heavens and the earth were completed, and all their host.
And the Divine ceased on the seventh day from all the work which had been made.
And the Divine blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it the Divine ceased from all work which the Divine had created to make.
These are the generations of the heavens and the earth in their being created, in the day that YHWH Elohim made earth and heavens.
And every shrub of the field was not yet in the earth, and every herb of the field had not yet grown—for YHWH Elohim had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no human to work the ground.
But a mist would rise from the earth and water the whole surface of the ground.
Then YHWH Elohim formed the human from the dust of the ground, and breathed into its nostrils the breath of life, and the human became a living being.
And YHWH Elohim planted a garden in Eden, toward the east, and there the Divine placed the human whom the Divine had formed.
And YHWH Elohim caused to grow from the ground every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food—and the Tree of Life in the midst of the garden, and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.
And a river went out from Eden to water the garden, and from there it divided and became four heads.
The name of the first is Pishon; it is the one that encircles all the land of Havilah, where there is gold.
And the gold of that land is good; there is bdellium and the onyx stone.
And the name of the second river is Gihon; it is the one that encircles all the land of Cush.
And the name of the third river is Hiddekel; it is the one that flows east of Asshur. And the fourth river is Perat.
And YHWH Elohim took the human and placed them in the garden of Eden to serve it and to guard it.
And YHWH Elohim commanded the human, saying: From every tree of the garden you may surely eat.
But from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat; for in the day you eat from it, you shall surely die.
And YHWH Elohim said: It is not good for the human to be alone; I will make for them a helper corresponding to them.
And YHWH Elohim formed from the ground every animal of the field and every bird of the sky, and brought them to the human to see what the human would call them; and whatever the human called a living being, that was its name.
And the human gave names to all the livestock, and to the birds of the sky, and to every animal of the field; but for the human, no helper was found corresponding to them.
And YHWH Elohim caused a deep sleep to fall upon the human, and they slept; and [the Divine] took one from their sides and closed up the flesh in its place.
And YHWH Elohim built the side taken from the human into a woman, and brought her to the human.
And the human said: This one, at last, is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, for from the human this one was taken.
Therefore, a man shall leave his father and his mother and cling to his partner, and they shall become one flesh.
And the two of them were naked, the human and his partner, and they were not ashamed.
