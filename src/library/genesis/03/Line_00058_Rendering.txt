[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And the woman said to the serpent, “From the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat.”

[RENDERING NOTES]

“And the woman said” renders וַתֹּאמֶר הָאִשָּׁה (vattomer ha’ishah), preserving the feminine singular narrative form and definite article.
“To the serpent” reflects אֶל־הַנָּחָשׁ (el-hannachash), with preposition and definite article.
“From the fruit of the tree of the garden” reflects מִפְּרִי עֵץ הַגָּן (miperi etz hagan), a compound construct phrase.
“We may eat” renders נֹאכֵל (no’khel), a first-person plural imperfect — indicating habitual or ongoing permission.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“The” inserted for “the woman,” “the serpent,” and “the garden” based on Hebrew definite articles.
Quotation marks used to frame direct speech for clarity.
“May” added to English verb to reflect modal implication of imperfect tense — habitual action.
No pronouns, adjectives, or interpretation added beyond the structure.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

This is the woman’s response to the serpent’s question from the previous verse.
It asserts partial knowledge of divine permission — possibly affirming, clarifying, or preparing for contrast.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Continues the speech-exchange pattern from Genesis 3:1.
Introduces the first direct response to a non-divine speaker in scripture.
Thematically echoes God’s earlier command in Genesis 2:16 — now voiced through the human character.
