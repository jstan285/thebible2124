[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And the serpent said to the woman, “You will not surely die.”

[RENDERING NOTES]

“And the serpent said” reflects וַיֹּאמֶר הַנָּחָשׁ (vayomer hannachash) — the vav-consecutive introduces speech, with subject marked by definite article.
“To the woman” renders אֶל־הָאִשָּׁה (el-ha’ishah), maintaining prepositional clarity.
“You will not surely die” translates לֹא מוֹת תְּמֻתוּן (lo mot temutun), an emphatically negated construction using infinitive absolute + imperfect.
The phrase directly mirrors and contradicts Genesis 2:17 and 3:3, reversing divine and human warnings.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“The” added before “serpent” and “woman” based on Hebrew definites.
Quotation marks added for clarity of direct speech.
No modal or interpretive helpers inserted — phrasing remains terse and structured.
English “surely” reflects the intensifying function of the infinitive absolute.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

This is the serpent’s direct rebuttal to the woman’s statement of divine command in Genesis 3:3.
Introduces the first recorded contradiction of God’s word in the narrative.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Direct structural inversion of Genesis 2:17 (“mot tamut”) — both use infinitive + imperfect.
“Lo” (not) placed frontally — a negation of divine consequence and boundary.
Continues speech structure set by 3:1 and 3:2–3, escalating tension.
