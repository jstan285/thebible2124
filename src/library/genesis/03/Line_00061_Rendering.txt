[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

For God knows that in the day you eat from it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“For God knows” renders כִּי יֹדֵעַ אֱלֹהִים (ki yodea Elohim), with “ki” signaling causation and “yodea” as participle “knowing.”
“That in the day you eat from it” (כִּי בְּיוֹם אֲכָלְכֶם מִמֶּנּוּ) — second “ki” again causal or temporal; “akholkhem” includes plural “you.”
“Your eyes will be opened” (וְנִפְקְחוּ עֵינֵיכֶם) uses a nifal perfect form, passive: “will be unveiled.”
“And you will be like God” (וִהְיִיתֶם כֵּאלֹהִים) includes “ke’Elohim” — literally “as God” or “like divine beings.”
“Knowing good and evil” (יֹדְעֵי טוֹב וָרָע) is a participial construct — “knowers of good and evil.”

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“That” added in two clauses for temporal and causal flow.
“Will be” inserted to express future perfect implications in verbs (נִפְקְחוּ / וִהְיִיתֶם).
“Like” from preposition “k-” — traceable.
No additional interpretive smoothing added.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Continues the serpent’s dialogue, expanding on the denial of death (3:4) with an alternative rationale.
Attributes motive to God — suggesting withheld knowledge or status.
Prepares the ground for human action by framing the consequence positively.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Echoes and reverses divine logic from Genesis 2:17 — reframing divine command as limitation rather than protection.
Three-part progression: divine knowing → human eating → transformation.
Thematic binary “good and evil” first introduced — foundational ethical polarity.
