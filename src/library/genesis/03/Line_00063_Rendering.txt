[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked. So they sewed fig leaves and made coverings for themselves.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Then the eyes of both of them were opened” (וַתִּפָּקַחְנָה עֵינֵי שְׁנֵיהֶם) — feminine plural verb matches dual noun construct.
“And they knew that they were naked” (וַיֵּדְעוּ כִּי עֵירֻמִּם הֵם) — realization clause using “ki” to mark awareness.
“So they sewed fig leaves” (וַיִּתְפְּרוּ עֲלֵה תְאֵנָה) — vav-consecutive action in response.
“And made coverings for themselves” (וַיַּעֲשׂוּ לָהֶם חֲגֹרֹת) — reflexive care, “for themselves.”

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“Then” inserted to signal sequential shift (vav-consecutive opening verb).
“That” added to causal clause “ki.”
“So” inserted to transition between realization and response.
“Coverings” chosen for “chagorot” — broader than “girdles,” retains neutrality.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Follows the act of eating (v.6), initiating immediate awareness and bodily consciousness.
Marks the first human-crafted response — covering, not dialogue.
Begins new relational axis: human-to-self, human-to-body, human-to-other.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Fulfillment of 3:5’s “your eyes will be opened” — structurally and lexically.
Sequence: perception → realization → action.
Thematic inversion: knowledge leads to concealment, not clarity.
