[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]
> “Vayishme’u... mithallekh bagan” forms a causative chain: auditory perception → source of motion.  
> Hithpael verb “mithallekh” conveys reflexive/repeated action.  
> “Leruach hayom” is a temporal indicator, generally understood as describing time of day or ambient condition.  
> Final clause uses “mipenei YHWH” to show spatial distancing, with “b’tokh etz hagan” as locational modifier.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]
> Masoretic text consistent across major witnesses.  
> LXX renders “walking in the garden in the cool of the day” with close semantic equivalence.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]
> Continues relational and environmental tension introduced in Genesis 3:7.  
> Repetition of divine names and garden motifs anchors this scene in narrative structure from Genesis 2–3.
