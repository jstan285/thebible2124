[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And YHWH God called to the human and said to him, “Where are you?”

[RENDERING NOTES]

“And YHWH God called” (וַיִּקְרָא יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים) — preserves compound divine name; vav-consecutive past narrative verb.
“To the human” (אֶל־הָאָדָם) — explicit prepositional direction, maintaining the definite article “the.”
“And said to him” (וַיֹּאמֶר לוֹ) — second verb with speech function; “lo” preserves 3ms pronominal suffix.
“Where are you?” (אַיֶּכָּה) — single-word interrogative with personal suffix, distinctive in Hebrew.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

Quotation marks added for clarity of direct speech.
No smoothing applied to interrogative — phrased as direct address.
No interpretive helpers inserted. Every word is traceable to a Hebrew counterpart.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Follows 3:8 where the human pair hides from YHWH’s presence.
This is the first recorded divine question in the canon — a relational call, not informational query.
Begins a cascade of divine questions in the Eden dialogue.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Uses a classic biblical narrative construction: vayiqra... vayomer
Balances divine initiative (“called”) with relational engagement (“said to him”)
The structure of address mirrors Genesis 1 naming formulae, but now turned toward estranged humanity.
