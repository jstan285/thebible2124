[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]
> “Vayiqra... vayomer” creates a dual action formula common in Hebrew narrative (call + speech).  
> The address “el-ha’adam” makes the object of divine speech explicit.  
> “Ayyekah” is a direct interrogative with a personal pronominal suffix — unique in Tanakh as an addressed question of presence/location.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]
> No textual variations noted in major Masoretic sources.  
> Septuagint renders “ποῦ εἶ” (“Where are you?”), a direct match in content.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]
> The verb “qara” (to call) echoes naming and summoning functions from Genesis 1 and 2.  
> “Ha’adam” reappears as the personal focal point amid divine relational discourse, continuing from 3:8.
