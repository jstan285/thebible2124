[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And he said, “Your voice I heard in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself.”

[RENDERING NOTES]

“And he said” (וַיֹּאמֶר) is a standard narrative introduction, maintaining sequential structure.
“Your voice I heard” (אֶת־קֹלְךָ שָׁמַעְתִּי) preserves Hebrew word order and direct object emphasis.
“In the garden” (בַּגָּן) includes preposition and definite article.
“And I was afraid” (וָאִירָא) uses imperfect with vav-consecutive, first person.
“Because I was naked” (כִּי עֵירֹם אָנֹכִי) includes causal particle “ki,” adjective “naked,” and pronoun “I.”
“And I hid myself” (וָאֵחָבֵא) reflects Niphal form — reflexive or passive aspect of hiding.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“I” and “myself” are directly derived from explicit pronouns or verbal forms in the Hebrew.
Quotation marks added to set off speech.
No interpretive smoothing applied — all elements trace to lexical source.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Immediate reply to divine question “Where are you?” in Genesis 3:9.
First human verbal response after the act of concealment in Genesis 3:8.
Introduces emotional vocabulary — fear — into human-divine interaction.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Uses three first-person verbs in sequence: “I heard,” “I was afraid,” “I hid.”
Narrative flow follows linear pattern of perception → emotion → action.
Phrase “because I was naked” functions as internal cause of fear — expanding on previous awareness from 3:7.
Embedded structure mirrors earlier divine speech forms now echoed by the human voice.
