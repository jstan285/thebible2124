[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]
> “Et-qol’kha shamati” is a complete clause with emphatic pronoun suffix on “qol’kha.”  
> Verbal sequence follows first-person narration using consecutive action: shamati → va’ira → va’e’chave.  
> “Ki eirom anokhi” forms the causal reason for fear.  
> Use of Niphal in final verb emphasizes reflexivity or personal concealment.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]
> No textual variations known in major manuscript traditions.  
> LXX parallels the structure semantically with no notable omissions.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]
> Follows directly from divine question in Genesis 3:9 (“ayyekah”) with human response.  
> Reinforces recurring motif of hearing and concealment seen in 3:8–9.  
> Verbs from שמע and חבא mirror language used in previous and subsequent Eden discourse.
