[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And He said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree which I commanded you not to eat from?”

[RENDERING NOTES]

“And He said” (וַיֹּאמֶר) continues the narrative flow; vav-consecutive, third person masculine singular.
“Who told you” (מִי הִגִּיד לְךָ) uses the Hifil perfect “higgid” — causative verb for “declare/make known.”
“That you were naked” (כִּי עֵירֹם אָתָּה) preserves word order; “ki” as causal or declarative conjunction.
“Have you eaten from the tree” (הֲמִן־הָעֵץ ... אָכָלְתָּ) uses interrogative particle “ha-min” to construct a yes/no question.
“Which I commanded you not to eat from” (אֲשֶׁר צִוִּיתִיךָ לְבִלְתִּי אֲכָל מִמֶּנּוּ) maintains full clause: “I commanded you not to eat from it.”

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“Have you” added for English clarity; reflects interrogative particle “ha-min.”
Second “from” inserted for natural English phrasing at sentence end.
No smoothing or paraphrasing introduced; all elements trace to original structure.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Immediately follows the human's confession of fear and nakedness in 3:10.
Marks God's direct interrogation — first mention of the tree by God post-violation.
Repeats and mirrors language from the original prohibition (2:17), forming a linguistic echo.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Dual question structure emphasizes revelation and accountability.
First question (“Who told you...”) probes source of new awareness.
Second question (“Have you eaten...”) initiates direct confrontation of transgression.
The phrase “asher tzivvitikha levilti akhal” structurally binds this line to God’s earlier command.
