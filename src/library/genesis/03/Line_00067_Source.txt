[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]
> Initial question “mi higgid lekha” initiates interrogation.  
> Double interrogative structure: “who told you...?” and “have you eaten...?” joined with causal “ki.”  
> Syntax uses rhetorical force by fronting “ha-min ha’etz” with the particle “ha-” signaling inquiry.  
> Verbal emphasis lies in divine command “tzivvitikha levilti akhal” and its violation “akhalta.”

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]
> No significant variation in major MT sources.  
> LXX preserves all interrogative and imperative structures with semantic parallels.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]
> Direct follow-up to Genesis 3:10, forming divine response to the man’s admission.  
> The root אכל (akal – to eat) ties closely with prior prohibitions in Genesis 2:17 and acts in 3:6.
