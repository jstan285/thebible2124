[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And the man said, “The woman whom You gave to be with me, she gave me from the tree, and I ate.”

[RENDERING NOTES]

“And the man said” (וַיֹּאמֶר הָאָדָם) — standard narrative speech introduction.
“The woman whom You gave to be with me” (הָאִשָּׁה אֲשֶׁר נָתַתָּה עִמָּדִי) — a relative clause identifying the woman by her divine origin and proximity.
“She gave me” (הִוא נָתְנָה־לִּי) — feminine verb form emphasizes her as subject of the action.
“From the tree” (מִן־הָעֵץ) — retains the prepositional structure from 3:11.
“And I ate” (וָאֹכֵל) — vav-consecutive imperfect first person, sequential completion.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“To be” added in English to render implied relational state “with me.”
Quotation marks used for clarity in direct speech.
No interpretive smoothing introduced; sequence and terms align with Hebrew structure.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Immediate reply to God’s inquiry in 3:11: “Have you eaten…?”
First human attempt at explanation post-transgression.
Introduces attribution — identifying the woman (and implicitly God) in the chain of causation.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Sequence mirrors Genesis 3:6 (“she gave to her husband... and he ate”).
Clause “whom You gave to be with me” echoes Genesis 2:22–23, now recast in blame.
Final clause is unembellished: “and I ate” — admission without denial.
The man frames responsibility in layered causality: divine gift → partner → action.
