[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]
> “Ha’ishah asher natattah immadi” is a relative clause modifying “ha’ishah,” attributing origin to divine action.  
> Double subject sequence: “hi nat’nah-li” sets the woman as agent of giving.  
> Temporal sequence preserved through consecutive verbs: “va’okhel” follows causal gifting.  
> The final clause is concise, without self-defense or elaboration.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]
> No major variations known in primary Masoretic witnesses.  
> LXX preserves similar relational clause structure and sequential actions.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]
> Continuation of dialogue begun in Genesis 3:11, presenting man’s direct response.  
> Shares key roots with Genesis 2:22 (“the woman whom you gave”) and 3:6 (“she gave to her husband”).
