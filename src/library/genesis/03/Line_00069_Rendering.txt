[RENDERED LINE]

Then YHWH Elohim said to the woman, “What is this you have done?” And the woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Then YHWH Elohim said” (וַיֹּאמֶר יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים) follows the narrative pattern of divine inquiry.
“To the woman” (לָאִשָּׁה) — direct address using the definite form.
“What is this you have done?” (מַה־זֹּאת עָשִׂית) — interrogative + demonstrative + perfect verb, 2nd feminine singular; conveys astonishment or demand for explanation.
“And the woman said” (וַתֹּאמֶר הָאִשָּׁה) — introduces reply with vav-consecutive feminine imperfect.
“The serpent deceived me” (הַנָּחָשׁ הִשִּׁיאַנִי) — subject + Hifil verb + 1cs suffix; cause-effect structure.
“And I ate” (וָאֹכֵל) — narrative conclusion matching 3:6 and 3:12; concise acknowledgment.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“Then” added for temporal flow; implied in vav-consecutive.
No smoothing or elaboration; quotation marks used for clarity in dialogue.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Final response in the triadic sequence of human replies to God.
Directly follows the man’s explanation/blame in 3:12.
Re-centers narrative on serpent's role, closing the dialogic loop initiated in 3:4–3:6.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

“What is this you have done?” parallels other divine challenges (e.g., Genesis 4:10).
Repeats pattern: divine question → human response → act acknowledgment.
“He deceived me, and I ate” aligns structurally with 3:12’s “she gave to me, and I ate.”
Sets stage for God’s direct address to the serpent in the following line.
