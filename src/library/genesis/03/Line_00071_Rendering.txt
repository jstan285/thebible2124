[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed. He shall strike your head, and you shall strike his heel.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“And I will put enmity” (וְאֵיבָה אָשִׁית) — divine action in first person, Qal imperfect = future intent.
“Between you and the woman… between your seed and her seed” — repeated prepositional phrases emphasize multiple relational layers.
“Seed” (זֶרַע) functions collectively and generationally — not limited to a single figure.
“He shall strike you (on) the head” (הוּא יְשׁוּפְךָ רֹאשׁ) — ambiguous but potent verb “shuph” (strike/crush) plus locative target “head.”
“You shall strike him (on) the heel” (וְאַתָּה תְּשׁוּפֶנּוּ עָקֵב) — mirrored structure, reduced position of impact.
Symmetrical verb-object-pronoun clauses suggest recurring conflict and balance.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“And” used throughout to preserve Hebrew connective “vav.”
“Shall” added for English future tense verb clarity.
No smoothing of metaphors; quotation marks excluded to allow narrative flow.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Climactic close of divine address to the serpent.
Shifts from current consequence (v.14) to generational prophecy.
Introduces enduring conflict between two lineages — interpretively pivotal for all Abrahamic traditions.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

“Seed” (zera) reappears as central in later covenants (e.g., Genesis 12, 15, 22).
Repetition of “between” establishes four-fold enmity: you↔woman, your seed↔her seed.
Structural mirroring in strike-strike clauses creates poetic balance and tension.
“Head” vs “heel” implies directional and hierarchical symbolism.
