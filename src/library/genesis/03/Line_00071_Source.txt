[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]
> Parallel structure of “beyn... uveyn” segments introduces layered hostility lines.  
> Both “yeshufkha rosh” and “teshufennu aqev” are symmetric verb-object phrases with pronominal suffixes.  
> “Enmity” (eyvah) is subject of the primary clause; final clauses forecast mutual conflict.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]
> MT is consistent across primary witnesses.  
> LXX renders “he shall watch against your head,” indicating early interpretive variance in “shuph.”  

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]
> Culmination of divine speech to serpent (vv. 14–15).  
> Introduces central motifs of conflict, descent, and generation that echo through Genesis.
