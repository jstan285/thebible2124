This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

To the woman he said, “Greatly I will increase your pain and your conception. In pain you shall bear children. And toward your man is your desire, and he shall rule over you.”

[RENDERING NOTES]

“To the woman he said” (אֶל־הָאִשָּׁה אָמַר) — standard divine address formula, used as in v.14.
“Greatly I will increase” (הַרְבָּה אַרְבֶּה) — infinitive absolute + imperfect verb; intensification construction in Hebrew.
“Your pain and your conception” (עִצְּבוֹנֵךְ וְהֵרוֹנֵךְ) — two paired internal conditions; not clearly separable.
“In pain you shall bear children” (בְּעֶצֶב תֵּלְדִי בָנִים) — root etzev repeated; birth through toil.
“And to your man is your desire” (וְאֶל־אִישֵׁךְ תְּשׁוּקָתֵךְ) — relational longing, ambiguous in tone.
“He shall rule over you” (וְהוּא יִמְשָׁל־בָּךְ) — Qal imperfect “yimshol” (rule/dominate); relational hierarchy introduced.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“Is” and “shall” inserted for English verb clarity.
“And” retained to mirror connective “vav” usage.
Quotation marks used to frame direct divine speech.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Second of three divine addresses (serpent → woman → man).
Marks transition from serpent’s cosmic curse to human embodied consequence.
Introduces themes of pain, procreation, and relational imbalance.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Mirrors 3:14 in structure (address formula + direct consequence).
Echoes and sets up structural reversal in Genesis 4:7 (desire/rule echo).
Double intensification (harbah arbeh) frames this consequence with marked emphasis.
