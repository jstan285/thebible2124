[RENDERED LINE]

And to the man he said, “Because you listened to the voice of your wife and ate from the tree about which I commanded you, saying, ‘You shall not eat from it,’ cursed is the ground because of you. In pain you shall eat from it all the days of your life.”

[RENDERING NOTES]

“And to the man he said” (וּלְאָדָם אָמַר) — parallel structure to 3:14, 3:16.
“Because you listened to the voice of your wife” — causal clause establishing basis for consequence.
“And ate from the tree” (וַתֹּאכַל מִן־הָעֵץ) — refers to direct action contrary to command.
“Which I commanded you, saying…” — embedded quotation structure to recall divine prohibition.
“Cursed is the ground because of you” — passive participle fronted for emphasis.
“In pain you shall eat from it” (בְּעִצָּבוֹן תֹּאכֲלֶנָּה) — echo of “pain” motif from 3:16; toil in contrast to earlier abundance.
“All the days of your life” — temporal closure; introduces lifelong burden.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“Because,” “about which,” “from it,” and quotation marks used for clarity and flow.
“Shall” added to express Hebrew imperfect forms in future/command modality.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Final divine address of the sequence (after serpent and woman).
Introduces transformation in relationship between human and ground.
Begins thematic shift toward mortality and labor.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Mirrors the structure of 3:14–16: direct address, cause, consequence.
Uses repetition of “eat” (akal) to bookend violation and penalty.
Sets up continuation in 3:18–19, culminating in return to dust.
