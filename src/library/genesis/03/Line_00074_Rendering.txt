[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And thorn and thistle it shall bring forth for you, and you shall eat the grass of the field.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“And thorn and thistle” (וְקוֹץ וְדַרְדַּר) — paired nouns linked by repetition of “ve” (and); poetic doubling.
“It shall bring forth” (תַּצְמִיחַ) — Hifil imperfect; refers back to “the ground” (implicit from v.17).
“For you” (לָךְ) — indirect object; the consequence is personalized.
“And you shall eat” (וְאָכַלְתָּ) — Qal perfect with vav-consecutive; continues future sequence from v.17.
“The grass of the field” (אֶת־עֵשֶׂב הַשָּׂדֶה) — direct object marked by “et”; contrasts with Edenic provision.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“It” supplied for subject clarity.
“Shall” inserted to match Hebrew imperfect tense.
“And” retained from Hebrew conjunctions.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Expands and deepens the ground-human rupture announced in v.17.
Introduces imagery of struggle and altered vegetation — not just cursed ground, but changed produce.
Reinforces relational shift between human and land.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Continues poetic-legal declaration style from v.17.
“Thorn and thistle” becomes a literary and theological motif echoed in later texts (e.g. Hosea 10:8, Hebrews 6:8).
