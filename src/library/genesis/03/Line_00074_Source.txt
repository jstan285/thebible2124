[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]
> Repetition of “ve” (and) links the thorn-thistle pairing.  
> Verb “tatzmiach” (it shall bring forth) is feminine, referring back to “ha’adamah” (ground) from the previous verse.  
> The direct object marker “et” signals “esev hasadeh” as the object of “ve’akhalta.”

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]
> No substantive variants in MT or LXX noted for this line.  
> LXX renders “thorns and thistles it shall bring forth to you,” closely matching Hebrew structure.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]
> Continues the theme from Genesis 3:17 regarding consequences tied to the ground.  
> Sets contrast with Edenic vegetation previously provided without labor (cf. Genesis 2:9).
