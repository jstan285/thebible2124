[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread until you return to the ground, for from it you were taken; for dust you are, and to dust you shall return.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“By the sweat of your face” (בְּזֵעַת אַפֶּיךָ) — construct phrase; evokes effortful labor, literal or symbolic.
“You shall eat bread” (תֹּאכַל לֶחֶם) — repetition of eating motif under new conditions (contrast with Eden).
“Until you return to the ground” (עַד שֻׁבְךָ אֶל־הָאֲדָמָה) — temporal clause tied to death and origin.
“For from it you were taken” (כִּי מִמֶּנָּה לֻקָּחְתָּ) — passive verb with clear origin reference.
“Dust you are, and to dust you shall return” (כִּי עָפָר אַתָּה וְאֶל־עָפָר תָּשׁוּב) — poetic parallelism; chiastic closure.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“By,” “until,” “for,” and conjunctions included for readability and logical linkage.
No additional helper nouns or verbs added beyond syntactic smoothing.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Culminates the divine consequence speech to the man.
Links labor (3:17–18) with mortality.
Echoes Genesis 2:7 — reversing origin moment with a return.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Final closure to the triplet consequence structure (3:14–19).
Uses sequential reasoning clauses (ki) to build toward thematic inevitability.
Pairs with 3:23–24 where the return to ground is enacted through exile.
