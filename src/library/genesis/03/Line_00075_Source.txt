[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]
> Begins with causal result of labor: “by the sweat of your face.”  
> Verb-object “tokhal lekhem” mirrors earlier agricultural labor references.  
> Coordinated clauses with temporal and causal sequencing: “until you return... because... for...”  
> Final phrase closes with chiastic echo: “dust you are... to dust you shall return.”

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]
> No significant textual variation noted in MT.  
> LXX renders “in sweat of your face you shall eat your bread,” preserving the core phrase order.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]
> Completes the consequence discourse begun in Genesis 3:17.  
> Ties back to origin (Genesis 2:7) and forward to mortality theme (Genesis 5:5).
