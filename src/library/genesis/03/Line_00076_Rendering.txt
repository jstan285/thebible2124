This isn’t a lesson. It’s a space. Come as you are. Let the line speak to you.

[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And the human called his wife's name Chavvah, for she was the mother of all the living.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“And…called” (וַיִּקְרָא) — vav-consecutive imperfect; marks a narrative shift and active naming.
“The human” (הָאָדָם) — ha’adam; not yet proper name “Adam” in Hebrew text.
“His wife's name Chavvah” (שֵׁם אִשְׁתּוֹ חַוָּה) — object structure, with name meaning embedded in next clause.
“For she was…” (כִּי הִיא הָיְתָה) — causal clause introducing rationale.
“Mother of all the living” (אֵם כָּל־חָי) — poetic title; uses “kol-chai” as collective life designation.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“And,” “his,” and “for” inserted for grammatical clarity, matching Hebrew conjunction and suffixes.
No additional smoothing beyond lexical alignment.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Follows the divine speeches to serpent, woman, and man.
Marks first recorded human naming act post-consequence.
Establishes Chavvah’s identity and role as progenitor — a hopeful gesture amid judgment.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Parallels Genesis 2:23, where the man names “ishah” (woman).
This naming is more narrative than biological — it seals identity and purpose.
The line acts as a hinge: closing Edenic consequence, opening genealogical sequence.

This rendering is provided for orientation only.
It draws from the Line Source File and reflects the structure of the original text as faithfully as possible, while adapting to minimal English phrasing.
