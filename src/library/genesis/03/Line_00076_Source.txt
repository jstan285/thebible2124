[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]
> Initial verb “vayiqra” sets a naming act — structured in subject-object-order form.  
> “ha’adam” is explicit subject; “shem ishto chavvah” is object phrase.  
> “ki hi hayetah em kol-chai” is a causal clause justifying the name choice, with pronoun “hi” as emphatic subject.  

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]
> No known significant MT or LXX variants for this line.  
> LXX renders Chavvah as Ζωή (Zōē), meaning “life,” aligning with Hebrew etymology.

> Shifts tone from divine speech to human response.  
> Completes the relational-human structure formed in 3:16–19 with a personal act of naming and acknowledgment.
