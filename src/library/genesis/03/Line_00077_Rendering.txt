[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And YHWH God made for the human and for his wife garments of skin, and clothed them.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“And…made” (וַיַּעַשׂ) — vav-consecutive + imperfect; signals sequential divine action.
“YHWH God” (יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים) — maintains the double naming formula from 2:4 onward.
“For the human and for his wife” (לְאָדָם וּלְאִשְׁתּוֹ) — dative construction indicates recipients of the action.
“Garments of skin” (כָּתְנוֹת עוֹר) — plural noun + material descriptor; evokes something tangible, durable, perhaps sacrificial.
“And clothed them” (וַיַּלְבִּשֵׁם) — hifil form; intensive causative verb reinforces divine action with tenderness.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“And,” “for,” and “of” used to replicate Hebrew structure in readable English.
No smoothing or elaboration beyond grammatical alignment.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Follows the naming of Chavvah in 3:20.
God takes action — a gesture of provision and continuity amid the consequences.
Prepares for the exile (3:22–24) with an act of covering and care.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Mirrors divine acts in Genesis 2:7–22 (forming, building, presenting).
Uses dual verbs: create (make) and clothe — both generative and relational.
Introduces theme of divine clothing that recurs in prophetic and priestly imagery (e.g., Zechariah 3, Exodus 28).
