[INTRO]  
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]  
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Westminster/Leningrad Codex.  
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.  
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.  
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.  
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.  
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]  
> The line opens with divine speech “Vayomer YHWH Elohim,” a formula common in Genesis.  
> The clause “ha’adam hayah ke’achad mimennu lada’at tov va-ra” is descriptive — stating a change in the human condition: becoming like “one of us,” having knowledge of good and evil.  
> The particle “ve‑attah pen…” introduces a precaution (“lest”) clause, with imperfect verbs following.  
> The sequence “yishlah yadho ve-lakah gam me’etstz hachayim” is a hypothetical potential action being prevented.  
> Final phrase “ve’achal va-chai le’olam” expresses the consequence being avoided: eating and living forever.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]  
> Major Masoretic Text witnesses (Westminster / Leningrad) are consistent in this line. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
> Septuagint and other ancient translations render similar structure; some interpret “like one of us” in corporate / divine council senses.  

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]  
> Follows immediately after God’s concern in Genesis 3:21 that humans might eat from the Tree of Life.  
> Acts as the closing logic to the prohibition section — the reason for excluding humans from eternal life in Eden.  
> Echoes themes of knowledge, life, and divine boundary set earlier (Genesis 2:16‑17).
