[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

So YHWH God sent him out from the garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Vayeshallchehu” — Piel form of “send,” intensive; implies forceful sending or expulsion.
“YHWH Elohim” — double-name formula retained; denotes covenantal divinity acting in justice and care.
“Mi-gan-‘eden” — “from the garden of Eden,” location of removal.
“La’avod et-ha’adamah” — infinitive construct indicating purpose: to work/till the ground.
“Asher luqqach misham” — relative clause identifying the ground: it is the source of his origin.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“So,” “from,” and “to” used to clarify temporal and directional logic in English.
No smoothing beyond clause alignment.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Follows divine deliberation about the human and the tree of life (v.22).
Begins the actual act of exile.
The human is moved from delight (Eden) to labor upon the land.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Parallel to Genesis 2:15 — human placed in Eden “to work it.”
Now redirected to work the same ground from which he was drawn (Genesis 2:7).
The motif of return (to origin) is activated without full restoration.
