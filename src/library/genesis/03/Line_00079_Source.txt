[INTRO]  
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]  
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.  
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.  
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.  
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.  
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.  
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]  
> Subject "YHWH Elohim" precedes the main verb.  
> Verb “vayeshallchehu” is Piel form, intensifying the sense of expulsion.  
> “La’avod et-ha’adamah” uses infinitive construct to express purpose/result.  
> Relative clause “asher luqqach misham” modifies “ha’adamah,” identifying it as the source of Adam’s creation.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]  
> LXX agrees closely with the Masoretic Text. No significant variants noted.  
> Verb structure and object alignment consistent across textual witnesses.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]  
> Direct continuation of divine action following Genesis 3:22.  
> Parallels Genesis 2:15 (“to work it and keep it”), but now in exile.  
> Echo of 3:19’s reference to ground and mortality.
