[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And the human knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain, and she said, “I have acquired a man with YHWH.”

[RENDERING NOTES]

“The human” renders וְהָאָדָם (ve-ha’adam), retaining the article and generic-personal ambiguity.
“Knew” follows the verb יָדַע (yada), with intimate and experiential connotations.
“Eve his wife” renders אֶת־חַוָּה אִשְׁתּוֹ, with direct object marker and possessive suffix.
“Conceived and bore” follows וַתַּהַר וַתֵּלֶד, a common sequential birth formula.
“Cain” is left unaltered to preserve proper noun recognition.
“I have acquired a man with YHWH” renders קָנִיתִי אִישׁ אֶת־יְהוָה, keeping grammatical subject and object structure.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

Inserted “and” before each clause for clarity and alignment with Hebrew vav-consecutive.
Quotation marks added for clarity around Eve’s direct speech.
“His” in “his wife” is traced directly to pronominal suffix; not interpretive.
No verbs or theological smoothing added.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

This line initiates the post-Eden narrative. It features the first act of conception and naming in the Torah.
Marks a pivot from divine creation to human generation, linking intimacy, creation, and divine invocation.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Mirrors the birth formula seen later (e.g., Gen 4:17, 21:2).
The verb “yada” reappears thematically in 4:17, reinforcing knowledge → birth → naming motifs.
Introduces verbal interplay between acquisition (qaniti) and the named child (qayin).
