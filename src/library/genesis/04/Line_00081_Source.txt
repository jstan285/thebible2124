[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

This line forms a narrative chain of actions: subject → verb → object (Adam knew Eve), followed by result clauses (she conceived and bore), then a speech clause from Eve.
Feminine verbs “vattahar,” “vatteled,” and “vattomer” maintain alignment with the subject “Chavvah.”
The direct object marker “et” precedes both “Chavvah” and “Qayin,” clarifying their grammatical roles.
The structure supports a cause-result pattern typical of biblical narrative sequences.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

No significant textual variants noted in Leningrad Codex or comparative Masoretic traditions for this verse.
The divine name appears as expected; Qumran sources (e.g., 4QGen) follow a similar pattern when preserved.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

First recorded conception and naming in Torah. The verb “yada” reappears in Genesis 4:17.
“Qaniti” (acquired) shares root with “qinyan” (possession) found elsewhere in Genesis.
Structural echo of birth formula “vattahar vatteled” recurs throughout Genesis (e.g., Gen 4:17, 21:2, 25:21).
