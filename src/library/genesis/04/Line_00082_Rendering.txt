[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And she continued to bear his brother, Abel. And Abel became a shepherd of flocks, and Cain was a worker of the ground.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“She continued to bear” translates וַתֹּסֶף לָלֶדֶת (vattosef laledet), a causative form indicating repeated birth.
“His brother, Abel” reflects אֶת־אָחִיו אֶת־הָבֶל, with doubled direct object markers emphasizing identification.
“Abel became a shepherd of flocks” renders וַיְהִי הֶבֶל רֹעֵה צֹאן, where participle רֹעֵה (ro’eh) denotes occupational identity.
“Cain was a worker of the ground” follows וְקַיִן הָיָה עֹבֵד אֲדָמָה, with participle עֹבֵד (oved) similarly expressing habitual action.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

Inserted “to” in “to bear” from infinitive construction לָלֶדֶת.
Added “became” and “was” to preserve English readability for participle forms with “vayhi” and “hayah.”
“Of” inserted in “shepherd of flocks” and “worker of the ground” for semantic linkage — not interpretive.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Follows the birth of Cain and Eve’s declaration (v.1). Introduces the sibling, Abel, and sets early conditions for the coming narrative conflict.
This line shifts the narrative from birth to identity — using occupation to foreshadow diverging paths.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

The mirrored participle structure (ro’eh / oved) establishes poetic parallelism.
The use of “ground” (אֲדָמָה) echoes Adam’s origin and the earlier curse of the soil (Gen 3:17–19), suggesting deeper thematic layers for Cain’s role.
