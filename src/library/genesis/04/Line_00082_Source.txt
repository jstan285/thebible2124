[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

The line is composed of two narrative sequences:
(1) Continuation of childbirth with “vattosef laledet” — a causative construction marking repeated action.
(2) Parallel statements of occupation: Hevel is described with a participle (“ro’eh”), as is Qayin (“oved”), marking ongoing identity or function.
Use of vav-consecutive with “vattosef” and “vayhi” sets rhythm in narrative time.
The phrase “et-achiv et-hevel” reinforces syntactic clarity and referential specificity.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

No documented deviations in the Leningrad Codex or major Masoretic manuscripts.
The structure and spelling of names align across known early Hebrew sources.
Some scribal traditions emphasize the repetition of “et” before both "achiv" and "hevel" to avoid ambiguity.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

The dual professions (shepherd and cultivator) reflect a motif of occupational contrast, seen again in Genesis 9:20 and Genesis 13:5–7.
Continuation of the “yalad” and “hayah” patterns begun in Genesis 4:1 and recurring throughout Genesis genealogies.
