[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And it happened at the end of days that Cain brought from the fruit of the ground an offering to YHWH.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“And it happened” renders וַיְהִי (vayhi), a narrative transition marker.
“At the end of days” follows מִקֵּץ יָמִים (miqqets yamim), indicating a passage of time without specifying a fixed interval.
“Brought” reflects causative וַיָּבֵא (vayave), implying intentional action.
“From the fruit of the ground” translates מִפְּרִי הָאֲדָמָה (mip’ri ha’adamah), with “from” indicating source.
“An offering” renders מִנְחָה (minchah), without assuming ritual connotation.
“To YHWH” reflects לַיהוָה (la-YHWH), indicating the recipient of the offering.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“It happened” inserted for English readability of וַיְהִי.
“At the end of” rendered to capture construct phrase “miqqets yamim.”
“That” inserted to connect temporal phrase with narrative event.
No smoothing or theological interpretation introduced.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

This line marks Cain’s first recorded initiative and begins the narrative of offerings.
It introduces the motif of bringing gifts to the divine — a pivotal thematic shift post-Eden.
Serves as the first recorded instance of human-to-divine offering in the text.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

The structure of “time passed → action → offering to deity” parallels sacrificial narratives elsewhere (e.g., Leviticus).
Opens narrative symmetry with the following verse (Abel’s offering), inviting implicit comparison.

This rendering is provided for orientation only.
It draws from the Line Source File and reflects the structure of the original text as faithfully as possible, while adapting to minimal English phrasing.
Interpretive meaning is not asserted. For lexical and grammatical details, consult the Line Source File.
