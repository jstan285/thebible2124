[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

The line follows a narrative construct: time marker (“miqqets yamim”) → subject + verb (“vayave qayin”) → object + recipient (“minchah la-YHWH”).
Use of the Hiphil verb “vayave” sets a tone of deliberate action.
“Minchah” as offering has ritual and relational implications in later Torah usage but is not defined here.
Prepositional phrases (“mip’ri ha’adamah” and “la-YHWH”) clarify source and destination of the offering.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

No significant variants attested in major Masoretic manuscripts.
Samaritan Pentateuch and Septuagint offer consistent readings, with slight syntactic reordering in Greek.
Dead Sea Scrolls fragments for this verse are not extant or preserved.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Continues narrative arc from Genesis 4:2 (Line_00082) involving Cain.
“Minchah” recurs in offerings by Abel (Genesis 4:4), and later becomes a technical term in Levitical priesthood texts.
Sets thematic precedent for sacrificial gifts and divine response in future lines.
