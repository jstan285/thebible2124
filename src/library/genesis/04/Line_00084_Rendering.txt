This isn’t a lesson. It’s a space. Come as you are. Let the line speak to you.

[FILE TAGS]
[LINE ID]: 00084
[BOOK]: Genesis
[CHAPTER]: 4
[VERSE]: 4
[FILE TYPE]: Line Rendering

[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And Abel also brought from the firstborn of his flock and from their fat portions, and YHWH regarded Abel and his offering.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“And Abel also brought” translates וְהֶבֶל הֵבִיא גַם־הוּא — maintaining emphasis from גַם־הוּא (“also he”).
“From the firstborn of his flock” renders מִבְּכֹרוֹת צֹאנוֹ — preserving possessive suffix.
“From their fat portions” is a direct rendering of וּמֵחֶלְבֵהֶן, reflecting sacrificial language without embellishment.
“Regarded” for וַיִּשַׁע (vayisha) retains the sense of divine attentiveness without over-translating favor.
“Toward Abel and his offering” reflects the double object of divine gaze — human and act.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

Added “and” at key junctions to match Hebrew vav-consecutive structure.
“Of” in “firstborn of” and “fat portions” included for construct relationships.
“Regarded” is a traceable rendering; not interpretive. No smoothing or evaluative terms added.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

This line completes the offering diptych begun in 4:3. It introduces divine response — not yet comparative, but attentive.
The spotlight shifts to Abel’s choice and quality, initiating the narrative tension that will follow.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Mirrors Genesis 4:3 with close structural symmetry.
Use of “minchah” ties both brothers’ acts into a unified offering framework.
“Sha’ah” (regard) marks divine attention — a rare verb, implying heightened narrative focus.

[CAUTIONARY REMINDER]
This rendering is provided for orientation only.
It draws from the Line Source File and reflects the structure of the original text as faithfully as possible, while adapting to minimal English phrasing.
Interpretive meaning is not asserted. For lexical and grammatical details, consult the Line Source File.
