[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

The first clause mirrors the previous verse, with a causative action verb (“hevi”) introducing Hevel’s gift.
The double-object phrase “mibekhorot tsono u-mechelvehen” indicates both origin (from the flock) and quality (fat portions).
“Vayisha YHWH…” introduces divine response using a verb of regard or attention, pointing toward Hevel and his minchah as separate but linked entities.
Coordinating structure: human action → divine perception.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

No notable variants in Masoretic manuscripts.
Septuagint mirrors structure but uses Greek terms for “fat portions” and “regard” that introduce interpretive nuances.
Qumran fragments for this passage are not extant.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Direct parallel with Genesis 4:3 (Line_00083), forming a comparative narrative arc between Cain and Hevel.
“Minchah” as a shared term anchors both offerings within a common ritual frame.
The verb “sha’ah” appears rarely, signaling specific acts of divine recognition.
