[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

But toward Cain and toward his offering He did not regard, and Cain burned greatly, and his face fell.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“But” inserted for contrast implied by shift in divine response.
“Toward Cain and toward his offering” translates וְאֶל־קַיִן וְאֶל־מִנְחָתוֹ — exact structural mirror of v.4.
“He did not regard” for לֹא שָׁעָה — negative particle with verb of attention/acceptance.
“Burned greatly” renders וַיִּחַר… מְאֹד — idiomatically expressing intense anger or internal heat.
“His face fell” mirrors וַיִּפְּלוּ פָנָיו — a Hebrew idiom for visible emotional dejection or shame.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“But” inserted to clarify the contrast with previous verse.
“He” inferred subject of “did not regard” from context.
“And” added to preserve vav-consecutive rhythm.
No smoothing or interpretive intensifiers added.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

This line completes the divine-offering diptych.
Abel was regarded; Cain was not — and here begins the emotional and narrative unraveling.
Introduces Cain’s emotional state for the first time in the text.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Direct mirroring of structure from v.4 deepens the contrast.
The pairing of emotional verb (“burned”) and idiomatic gesture (“face fell”) sets a poetic cadence.
Repetition of “minchah” reinforces thematic centrality of the offering motif.
