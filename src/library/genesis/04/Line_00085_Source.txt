[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

The line opens with a contrastive clause (“ve-el Qayin… lo sha’ah”), continuing directly from 4:4.
The verb “sha’ah” reappears, now negated with “lo,” establishing divine non-regard.
A result clause follows: emotional reaction (“vayichar… me’od”) and physical expression (“vayippelu panav”).
The verb-subject inversion of “vayippelu panav” (literally: “fell his face”) is idiomatic and structurally common in biblical Hebrew.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

No significant textual variants present in major Masoretic sources.
Septuagint uses a Greek construction that approximates emotional response (“Cain was greatly grieved”), but differs syntactically.
Samaritan Pentateuch retains the Hebrew structure; no notable divergence.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Continues direct contrast between Cain (Line_00083) and Hevel (Line_00084).
The verb “charah” appears again in Genesis 18:30; common for divine or human anger.
“Panim” in emotional states recurs in Genesis 31:2 and 40:7.
