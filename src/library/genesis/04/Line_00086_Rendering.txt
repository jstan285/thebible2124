[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And YHWH said to Cain, “Why did you burn? And why have your face-facings fallen?”

[RENDERING NOTES]

“And YHWH said” renders וַיֹּאמֶר יְהוָה — recurring divine speech formula.
“To Cain” preserves אֶל־קַיִן as directional phrase.
“Why did you burn?” preserves לָמָה חָרָה לָךְ, using the emotional verb “charah” literally as “burn.”
“Why have your face-facings fallen?” reflects וְלָמָה נָפְלוּ פָנֶיךָ, preserving plural “panim” with pronominal suffix.
Maintains the poetic parallelism and emotional immediacy of the Hebrew.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

No interpretive helper words added.
Retained literal phrasing for “burn” and “face-facings” to echo wordplay and idiom structure.
Quotation marks used to frame direct speech.
Tense choices based on perfect verb forms; subject and action preserved.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

This line initiates divine speech in response to Cain’s emotional state.
It shifts the narrative into dialogic mode, introducing the divine voice as reflective and interrogative.
The questions are rhetorical — inviting self-awareness rather than condemnation.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

The dual “lamah” structure frames the line symmetrically.
Mirrors divine inquiry patterns seen in Genesis 3:9 (“Where are you?”) and 4:9 (“Where is your brother?”).
The use of bodily and emotional language reflects holistic engagement — inner fire and outer collapse.
