[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

The line is composed of a divine question formed in two parallel interrogatives, both beginning with “lamah.”
The first clause “lamah charah lakh” reflects emotional state; the second, “ve-lamah naflu faneikha,” physical expression of that state.
The verbs “charah” and “naflu” are both perfect forms, indicating completed condition or current result.
Pronoun suffixes ("lakh", "faneikha") personalize the address toward Qayin.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

No significant textual variants noted in Masoretic manuscripts.
Septuagint rendering reflects similar structure but paraphrases “why are you pained” in place of “burned.”

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Direct continuation of Line_00085 (Genesis 4:5), with "charah" echoing Cain’s emotional state.
The motif of divine inquiry (“vayomer YHWH el...”) recurs in Genesis 3:9 and 4:9.
The rhetorical dual-question structure anticipates themes of personal accountability and inner posture.
