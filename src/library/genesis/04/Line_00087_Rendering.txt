[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

Is it not so: if you do well, lifting? But if you do not do well—at the opening, sin is crouching. Toward you is its desire, but you may rule over it.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Is it not so” reflects הֲלוֹא — rhetorical interrogative particle.
“If you do well, lifting” preserves the pairing of תֵּיטִיב and שְׂאֵת — retaining ambiguity between “lifting” as result or state.
“But if you do not do well” matches וְאִם לֹא תֵיטִיב — parallel clause structure.
“At the opening, sin is crouching” is a close rendering of לַפֶּתַח חַטָּאת רֹבֵץ — retaining spatial metaphor and present participle.
“Toward you is its desire” retains the directional ve-eilekha and noun teshuqato — noting relational pull.
“But you may rule over it” mirrors וְאַתָּה תִּמְשָׁל־בּוֹ — preserving volitional possibility without imperative tone.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“Is it not so” added for rhetorical clarity of הֲלוֹא.
“But” used for clause contrast (וְאִם).
No smoothing of “se’et” — left as noun (“lifting”) to preserve multivalence.
All directional and possessive suffixes retained explicitly.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Continuation of divine speech to Cain. This line articulates moral potential, temptation, and agency.
Pivotal ethical teaching—both warning and empowerment—just before narrative rupture.
Suggests divine concern for inner state, not merely outer action.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Two “if” clauses mirror each other — forming a chiastic and conditional structure.
Crouching sin and rising self form opposing vectors.
Echoes Gen 3:16 in teshuqah usage — relational desire mirrored across domains.
