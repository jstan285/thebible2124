[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

The line is a conditional sentence using parallel “im” clauses: “if you do well… if you do not…”
“Se’et” is positioned as a consequential result of doing well — open to multiple syntactic readings (nominal or verbal).
A personified metaphor follows (“sin crouches at the door”), continued with possessive desire language and an imperative counter-clause (“you shall rule over it”).
Chiastic and poetic structure is often noted in scholarly linguistic observations.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

No significant variants noted in Masoretic manuscripts for this line.
Septuagint renders several terms more abstractly — e.g., “rule over it” as “you will master it,” while retaining essential structure.
Samaritan Pentateuch aligns with Masoretic wording.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Builds on divine dialogue from Genesis 4:6 (Line_00086).
The verbs “teitiv” and “timshol” form mirrored moral and volitional poles.
“Teshuqato” echoes Genesis 3:16, creating a structural link between interpersonal desire and moral agency.
