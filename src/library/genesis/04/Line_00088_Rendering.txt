[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And Cain said to Abel his brother. And it happened, when they were in the field—Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and he killed him.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“And Cain said to Abel his brother” reflects וַיֹּאמֶר קַיִן אֶל־הֶבֶל אָחִיו — a typical speech-introduction formula, though no words are preserved in MT.
“And it happened, when they were in the field” preserves וַיְהִי בִּהְיוֹתָם בַּשָּׂדֶה as temporal setting.
“Cain rose up against Abel his brother” renders וַיָּקָם קַיִן אֶל־הֶבֶל אָחִיו with explicit directional intent.
“And he killed him” renders וַיַּהַרְגֵהוּ — retaining suffix clarity (“he killed him”).
Repetition of “Abel his brother” mirrors Hebrew and emphasizes relationship.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

Sentence-ending punctuation added for clarity.
No interpretive smoothing — retained abrupt transition from speech intro to action.
No quotation inserted despite missing speech in MT; preserved textual silence.
“When” added for temporal linkage (“bihyotam”).

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Narrative apex of Cain-Abel arc.
First recorded act of interpersonal violence — human-originated death.
Follows unheeded divine warning and threshold temptation.
Textual silence after “he said” invites interpretive space.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

“Vayomer… vayhi… vayaqam… vayahargehu” — cascading verbal sequence.
Parallel of “el-Hevel achiv” at start and midpoint frames the fraternal relationship.
Suddenness reflects moral rupture — no explanation, no delay.
