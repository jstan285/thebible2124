[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

The verse features a two-part narrative structure: initial dialogue setup (“vayomer...”) followed by situational event (“vayhi bihyotam...”) and culminating action (“vayaqam... vayahargehu”).
Repetition of “el-hevel achiv” emphasizes relational identity and intent.
The use of “vayahargehu” with the suffix directly identifies the victim (his brother), preserving clarity in minimal words.
No dialogue is preserved in the Masoretic text after “vayomer”; the phrase stands without a recorded statement.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

Samaritan Pentateuch and some Septuagint manuscripts include an extended version of Cain’s speech (e.g., “Let us go out to the field”), which is not preserved in the Masoretic Text.
Dead Sea Scroll fragment 4QGenb includes similar expansion.
The MT reflects a shorter reading, with “vayomer Qayin el-Hevel achiv” not followed by direct quotation.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Culmination of the rising narrative tension from Lines 00083–00087.
“Vayahargehu” establishes the first human-to-human killing in biblical record.
The verbal pairing of “vayaqam” and “vayahargehu” parallels hostile action scenes elsewhere (e.g., Exodus 2:12).
