[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

The verse contains a divine inquiry (“ei Hevel achikha”) and human denial/deflection (“lo yadati… ha-shomer achi anokhi”).
Cain’s reply is composed of two statements: a direct negation of knowledge and a rhetorical question using participial form (“ha-shomer”).
The pronoun “anokhi” serves as an emphatic conclusion, stressing subjectivity.
Parallel to earlier divine interrogatives in Genesis 3:9, 3:11, and 4:6.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

No major textual variants are found in Masoretic tradition for this verse.
Septuagint and Samaritan Pentateuch agree closely in structure and phrasing.
Dead Sea Scrolls fragments for this line are not extant or identified to date.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Continues direct narrative sequence from Genesis 4:8 (Line_00088).
Lexical echo of “yada” (to know) links back to Genesis 4:1 and anticipates moral accountability themes throughout the Torah.
“Shomer” as a role appears again in Psalm 121 and other protection-based contexts.
