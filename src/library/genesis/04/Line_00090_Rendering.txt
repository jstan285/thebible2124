[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And He said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s bloods is crying out to Me from the ground.”

[RENDERING NOTES]

“And He said” translates וַיֹּאמֶר — divine speech continuation.
“What have you done?” reflects מֶה עָשִׂיתָ — direct moral inquiry; identical to the question to Eve (Gen 3:13).
“The voice of your brother’s bloods” keeps plural “demei” for intensity — indicating full life or multiplied impact.
“Is crying out to Me” reflects participial צֹעֲקִים — continuous present, “crying” or “calling.”
“From the ground” (מִן־הָאֲדָמָה) reintroduces “adamah” as witness medium; ties to Genesis 3:17 and 4:2.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“Is” added to bridge English participial form.
“To Me” maintained as direct prepositional translation of אֵלַי.
All structure follows Hebrew sequence; minimal interpretive additions.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Immediate divine response to Cain’s denial (v.9).
Combines interrogation and revelation: what Cain has concealed is already known to the ground.
Marks the first explicit moral link between human action and the voice of the earth.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Parallel to Genesis 3:13 (“What is this you have done?”).
“Voice” (qol) paired with “bloods” (demei) creates multi-sensory synesthesia: sound rising from substance.
The plural “bloods” anticipates the generational and communal consequences of the act.
Earth as moral sensor: the ground records human action.
