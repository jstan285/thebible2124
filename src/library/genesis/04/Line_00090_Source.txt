[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

The line opens with divine interrogation (“meh asita”), followed by a poetic accusation in construct form.
“Qol demei achikha tso’aqim” is a construct phrase meaning “voice of your brother’s bloods [is] crying out,” with no explicit verb.
Use of plural “demei” (bloods) may indicate intensity or completeness of the act.
The participial verb “tso’aqim” follows the construct noun and agrees in plurality with “demei.”
Final clause “min-ha’adamah” situates the cry’s origin, reinforcing the ground as witness or medium.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

No notable textual variants in the Masoretic manuscripts.
Septuagint renders “voice of your brother’s blood cries” singular, possibly simplifying the plural nuance.
Samaritan Pentateuch reflects the same structure as MT.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Continuation of divine response sequence from Genesis 4:9 (Line_00089).
Echoes Genesis 3:13–14 where interrogation follows a transgression.
“Adamah” and “dam” are linked thematically and linguistically — both reappear throughout Torah in contexts of moral and ritual consequence.
