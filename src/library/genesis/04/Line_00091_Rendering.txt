[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to take your brother’s bloods from your hand.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“And now” reflects וְעַתָּה (ve-attah), marking the transition from inquiry to judgment.
“Cursed are you” (אָרוּר אָתָּה) mirrors the judgment formula in Genesis 3:14, maintaining judicial cadence.
“From the ground” (מִן־הָאֲדָמָה) retains the spatial preposition “min” and signals alienation from the very soil Cain worked.
“Which has opened its mouth” translates אֲשֶׁר פָּצְתָה אֶת־פִּיהָ — preserving feminine verb agreement with “adamah.”
“To take your brother’s bloods from your hand” mirrors infinitive clause לָקַחַת אֶת־דְּמֵי אָחִיךָ מִיָּדֶךָ — keeping “bloods” plural for conceptual fullness and moral weight.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“Are” added in “you are cursed” for English grammar.
“Its” inserted to clarify pronominal suffix of “mouth.”
Definite article “the” omitted where Hebrew does not require it.
Phrasing otherwise direct and minimally adapted.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Divine pronouncement of consequence follows Cain’s denial and the revelation of Abel’s blood crying from the ground.
Marks a reversal: the ground that once yielded to Cain now turns against him.
Represents the shift from moral exposure (v.10) to cosmic rebalancing (v.11).

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Parallels “cursed are you” (Genesis 3:14) spoken to the serpent — same formula, different object.
The “ground” moves from passive medium to active participant.
The structure (announcement → relative clause → purpose clause) mirrors judgment syntax in Genesis 3.
“Bloods from your hand” creates a closed moral circuit linking act, victim, and earth.
