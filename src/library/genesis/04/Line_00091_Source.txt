[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

This line opens with a judicial declaration (“arur attah”) and builds on a causal clause beginning with “asher.”
The feminine verb “patztah” agrees with the subject “adamah,” showing personification of the ground.
Infinitive “lakachat” functions purposefully: the ground opened “to take” the brother’s blood.
Final phrase “miyadekha” grammatically links Cain to the responsibility of the action — emphasized by position and suffix.
Sentence exhibits cause-effect and judgmental structure typical of divine legal pronouncements.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

No major textual variants noted in the Masoretic tradition for this verse.
Septuagint rendering aligns closely, though the opening judgment is translated as a direct consequence (“Now you are cursed from the earth…”).
Samaritan Pentateuch matches MT in this passage.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Directly follows Genesis 4:10 (Line_00090) where the blood cries out.
“Arur attah” parallels Genesis 3:14 (“arur atah mikol ha-behemah”), reflecting structured judgment formulas.
Continues thematic linkage between human sin and ground response first seen in Genesis 3:17–19.
