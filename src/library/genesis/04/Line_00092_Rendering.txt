This isn’t a lesson. It’s a space. Come as you are. Let the line speak to you.

[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

When you work the ground, it will no longer yield her strength to you. A wanderer and a fugitive you will be in the land.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“When you work the ground” translates כִּי תַעֲבֹד אֶת־הָאֲדָמָה — preserving conditional logic with direct object marker.
“It will no longer yield” captures לֹא־תֹסֵף תֵּת — combining future negation with infinitive construction.
“Her strength” (כֹּחָהּ) retains feminine suffix referring to adamah — personified as withholding energy.
“To you” (לָךְ) marks directional loss — Cain remains active but fruitless.
“A wanderer and a fugitive” translates נָע וָנָד — poetic hendiadys emphasizing dislocation.
“You will be in the land” (תִּהְיֶה בָאָרֶץ) finalizes consequence with existential shift: dislocated within presence.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“It will” added for clarity in future tense rendering.
“Her” retained directly from Hebrew suffix; no interpretive insertion.
“A” added before “wanderer” and “fugitive” to convey role categories in English.
Sequence mirrors original structure without smoothing.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Expands the curse from v.11 into active consequence.
Cain is not removed from the land — but rendered incapable of anchoring to it.
Line introduces the dual exile: from soil productivity and from social rootedness.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Builds upon Genesis 3:17–19 — laboring the ground post-transgression.
“Na va-nad” mirrors poetic pairings in other exile texts (e.g., Ishmael, Israel’s wanderings).
Continues judicial speech from God — three-part decree: guilt revealed (v.10), curse delivered (v.11), function severed (v.12).
