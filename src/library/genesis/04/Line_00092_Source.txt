[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

The line uses a conditional causal structure: “When you work the ground... it will not yield...”
The pair “na va-nad” forms a poetic doublet — both describing movement, displacement, and restlessness.
“Tihyeh ba’aretz” finalizes the sentence with a futural existential clause — “you shall be in the land” as one who is unsettled.
The feminine subject in “tosef tet-kochah” is grammatically linked to “adamah,” reinforcing the personification of the ground.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

Septuagint renders “you will groan and tremble on the earth,” emphasizing emotional and physical response, though preserving basic structure.
No major deviations found in Samaritan Pentateuch or Dead Sea Scroll fragments for this verse.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Follows Genesis 4:11 (Line_00091), expanding the curse with concrete consequence.
“Na va-nad tihyeh” introduces a motif of exile and dislocation that reappears with Cain, Ishmael, and Israel.
Echoes the punishment framework introduced in Genesis 3:17–19 regarding Adam’s labor of the ground.
