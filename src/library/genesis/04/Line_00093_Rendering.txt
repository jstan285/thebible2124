[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And Cain said to YHWH, “My guilt is too great to bear.”

[RENDERING NOTES]

“And Cain said to YHWH” mirrors the simple narrative verb structure וַיֹּאמֶר ... אֶל־יְהוָה — no additions.
“My guilt” (עֲוֺנִי) carries double meaning — wrongdoing and punishment — left open in this phrasing.
“Too great to bear” translates גָּדוֹל ... מִנְּשֹׂא — keeping idiomatic intensifier intact, indicating unendurable burden.
No verb needed between “gadol” and “avoni” per biblical syntax norms; English inserts “is” for readability.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“Is” added for basic grammatical flow.
Quotation marks included to clarify direct speech.
All other elements directly mirror Hebrew phrasing and order.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Immediate reaction to divine pronouncement in Genesis 4:12.
This is Cain’s only verbal response in the judgment sequence.
Introduces theme of unbearable consequence — first articulation of human despair in scripture.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Uses lament formula — short, emphatic declaration without verb.
“Gadol avoni min-neso” links to burden language in Exodus and Numbers.
Statement of overwhelming inner state mirrors the Psalmic “my guilt overwhelms me” genre.
Structure is a reversal of defense: from denial (v.9) to overwhelmed concession (v.13).
