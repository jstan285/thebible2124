[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

A short but intense lament, structured as a declaration from Cain to YHWH.
The predicate “gadol” precedes the subject “avoni,” emphasizing severity.
The phrase “min-neso” functions idiomatically — “greater than can be borne.”
No explicit verb is used between subject and predicate, a common biblical structure for emphatic declarations.
This is Cain’s only direct response to the judgment sequence.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

LXX (Septuagint) renders: “My crime is too great for me to be forgiven,” adding interpretive weight not present in the MT.
Samaritan Pentateuch mirrors MT closely, preserving compact form.
No known DSS variants extant for this verse.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Immediate response to Genesis 4:12 (Line_00092), forming a reaction-judgment pattern.
The use of “avon” anticipates its reappearance in legal and sacrificial contexts throughout Torah (e.g., Leviticus 16).
Connects structurally to other burden-bearing phrases (e.g., Exodus 18:18; Numbers 11:14).
