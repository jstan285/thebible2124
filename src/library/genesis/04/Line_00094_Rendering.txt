[YOU ARE WELCOME HERE]
This isn’t a lesson. It’s a space. Come as you are. Let the line speak to you.

[LINE ID]: 00094
[BOOK]: Genesis

[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

See—today you have driven me away from the face of the ground, and from your presence I will be hidden. I will be a wanderer and a fugitive in the land, and anyone who finds me will kill me.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“See—today” (הֵן ... הַיּוֹם) reflects immediate lament; “hen” functions as interjection (“behold,” “surely”).
“You have driven me away” translates גֵּרַשְׁתָּ אֹתִי — direct second person with 1st-person object.
“From the face of the ground” (מֵעַל פְּנֵי הָאֲדָמָה) retains layered imagery — not just location but relational surface.
“From your presence I will be hidden” (וּמִפָּנֶיךָ אֶסָּתֵר) keeps passive/reflexive sense of Niphal verb — concealment may be chosen or enforced.
“A wanderer and a fugitive” = נָע וָנָד — double exile reinforced from v.12.
“In the land” (בָּאָרֶץ) sustains paradox: within terrain, but without home.
“Anyone who finds me will kill me” maintains participial universal: כָּל־מֹצְאִי יַהַרְגֵנִי.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“See—” inserted to carry “hen” interjection.
“You have” added for perfect tense completion.
“Will be” and “will kill” inserted as standard future auxiliaries.
Quotation punctuation used to organize reported speech, per English clarity norms.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Continues Cain’s lamentation, begun in v.13 — now with expanded implications.
Reflects not only internal burden but anticipatory fear of external retaliation.
Introduces “killer of the killer” motif into early Torah narrative.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Builds on motifs from v.12 and v.13: loss of soil, presence, and social coherence.
Uses three-part structure: expulsion → divine separation → social fear.
Repeats “na va-nad” from v.12 as recursive thematic anchor.
Narrative pause: first time a character anticipates future violence from others — emergence of societal consequence.
