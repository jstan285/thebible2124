[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

Structured as a full lamentation by Cain: declaration, consequence, fear.
"Hen gerashta oti hayom" establishes temporal immediacy and expulsion.
“U-mippanekha essater” adds relational exile — loss of divine presence.
Doublet “na va-nad” repeats motif of instability and displacement.
Final clause “kol motze’i yahargeni” expresses fear of retaliation, again using participial construction for generality.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

LXX adds slight interpretive expansion in “whoever finds me will kill me.”
Samaritan Pentateuch agrees with MT on major structural elements.
No extant DSS fragments of this specific line identified.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Follows directly from Line_00093 (Genesis 4:13) as continuation of Cain’s speech.
Expands emotional and existential fallout of divine judgment.
“Na va-nad” repeats from Genesis 4:12 (Line_00092), emphasizing curse's embodiment.
