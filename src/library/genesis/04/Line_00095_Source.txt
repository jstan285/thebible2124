[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

Divine response structured in three actions: decree, protection, sign.
“Lo-khen” negates Cain’s fear from Genesis 4:14.
Passive verb “yuqqam” signals divine enforcement of justice.
“Ot” (sign) remains undefined, emphasizing mystery and function over form.
Use of “le-vilti hakkot-oto” clarifies protective intent.
Final participial phrase “kol-motze’o” generalizes threat.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

LXX adds interpretive phrases (“the Lord set a sign for Cain, that no one who found him should slay him”), consistent with MT.
Samaritan Pentateuch agrees closely.
No major DSS variants noted for this line.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Resolves Cain’s protest in Genesis 4:14 (Line_00094).
Introduces motif of divine marking — reappears with Exodus 12, Ezekiel 9.
“Shiv’atayim” anticipates future vengeance language (e.g., Genesis 4:24).
