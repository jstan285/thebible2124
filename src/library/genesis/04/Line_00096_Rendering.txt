[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And Cain went out from before YHWH and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“And Cain went out” = וַיֵּצֵא קַיִן — sequential narrative verb with subject.
“From before YHWH” (מִלִּפְנֵי יְהוָה) = spatial and relational distancing; a departure from presence.
“Settled” (וַיֵּשֶׁב) retains primary meaning “he dwelled” but connotes longer-term presence than “sat.”
“In the land of Nod” (בְּאֶרֶץ־נוֹד) — place-name with wordplay on “wandering” (נוד).
“East of Eden” (קִדְמַת־עֵדֶן) = directional geography that continues Eden as central orienting feature.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“From before” inserted for idiomatic clarity; supports prepositional nuance.
“And” and “in the” added to preserve vav-consecutive and English naturalism.
No smoothing or interpretation added beyond what is directly indicated in structure.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Marks the narrative conclusion of Cain’s presence in divine space.
Follows the sign-of-protection episode in v.15 — now action follows decree.
Continues the theme of exile eastward, echoing Genesis 3:24.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Double vav-consecutive (“he went out… he settled”) reinforces narrative finality.
Eden remains the gravitational center — its eastward departure reflects increasing distance from the primordial sacred.
“Nod” thematically and linguistically echoes Cain’s judgment as “na va-nad” (wanderer and fugitive) — now spatialized.
