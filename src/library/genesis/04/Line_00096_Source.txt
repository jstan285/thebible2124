[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

Double vav-consecutive verbs (“vayetze … vayyeshev”) create sequential narrative flow.
“Milifnei YHWH” expresses relational departure — presence being left.
“Be’eretz-nod” combines physical geography with thematic exile.
Construct “kidmat-eden” forms directional positioning — Eden remains a fixed point of reference.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

LXX (Septuagint) aligns closely: “Cain went out from the presence of God and dwelt in the land of Nod, east of Eden.”
Samaritan Pentateuch supports MT text with no significant variation noted.
No known Dead Sea Scrolls fragments for this line.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Concludes the Cain narrative arc that began in Genesis 4:1 (Line_00081).
Continues and finalizes the exile theme initiated in Genesis 3:24 and 4:11–14.
“Nod” reflects Cain’s earlier judgment to become a “na va-nad” (wanderer and fugitive).
Eden as orienting point remains consistent with Genesis 2–3 framework.
