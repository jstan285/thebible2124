[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and gave birth to Enoch. And he was building a city, and he called the name of the city like the name of his son — Enoch.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Knew his wife” (וַיֵּדַע ... אֶת־אִשְׁתּוֹ) preserves biblical euphemism for sexual relations.
“She conceived and gave birth” = vav-consecutive pair (וַתַּהַר וַתֵּלֶד), narrative flow from conception to birth.
“He was building” = participial form (בֹנֶה) signals ongoing or habitual action, rather than a completed event.
“A city” (עִיר) is indefinite; article appears only later when naming it.
“Like the name of his son” (כְּשֵׁם בְּנוֹ) is comparative structure — not exact replication but modeled after.
Proper name “Enoch” occurs twice — both son and city.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“And” used to preserve sequential rhythm of vav-consecutives.
“Was” added to render participle “building” clearly in English.
Long dash used to convey appositional clause cleanly in English.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Begins Cain’s lineage and introduces the first urban structure.
Marks narrative shift from personal to generational — Cain now father and founder.
Introduces tension between wandering punishment and settled civilization.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Four-part flow: union → birth → building → naming.
Balances domestic continuity with urban innovation.
Use of participle (“building”) contrasts with prior narrative perfects — implies progressive activity.
Naming functions as legacy — city as extension of son.
