[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

Structured in four clauses, all joined by vav-consecutives to show action sequence.
First clause: Cain “knew” his wife — euphemism for sexual union.
Second clause: she conceives and gives birth to Enoch.
Third clause: Cain is described as “building a city” — participial usage denotes active role.
Fourth clause: he names the city after his son — “keshem beno” uses construct form.
Repetitions of proper names frame narrative continuation through lineage.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

LXX (Septuagint) preserves parallel clause structure and names.
Some LXX manuscripts rephrase order slightly, but MT sequence retained.
Samaritan Pentateuch aligns closely with Masoretic structure.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Begins Cainite genealogy and urbanization theme that runs through Genesis 4.
First biblical reference to city-building — introduces “ir” as structural unit.
“Enoch” here not to be confused with the Enoch of Sethite line (Genesis 5:18).
Transitions narrative focus from Cain to his descendants (continued in Genesis 4:18).
