[YOU ARE WELCOME HERE]
This isn’t a lesson. It’s a space. Come as you are. Let the line speak to you.

[FILE TAGS]
[LINE ID]: 00098
[BOOK]: Genesis
[CHAPTER]: 4
[VERSE]: 18
[FILE TYPE]: Line Rendering

[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And to Enoch was born Irad. And Irad fathered Mehujael, and Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“And to Enoch was born Irad” = וַיִּוָּלֵד לַחֲנוֹךְ אִירָד — passive verbal form, subject (“Irad”) receives action.
“Yalad” (יָלַד) = standard verb for fathering or begetting; used three times here in perfect form.
Use of direct object marker “et” (אֶת) before each name following “yalad” reinforces syntactic consistency.
No verbs of movement or speech — strictly genealogical function.
All four names are masculine proper nouns.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“Was born” inserted to render Niphal passive appropriately in English.
“Fathered” used consistently for “yalad” rather than “begot” or “gave birth to,” to match male lineage framing.
“And” retains rhythm of vav-consecutive.
No interpretive smoothing added.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Continues Cain’s lineage after the city-building of Enoch.
Forms a generational chain leading to Lamech — who receives extended attention in upcoming lines.
No events described — purely generative progression.
Establishes names without narrative traits — archetypal anonymity.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Four-generation sequence: Enoch → Irad → Mehujael → Methushael → Lamech.
Symmetrical repetition of “yalad” creates genealogical rhythm.
Opening passive form separates Enoch from the active fathering pattern — transition moment.
Reinforces Cain’s descent as parallel but distinct from Seth’s later genealogy.
