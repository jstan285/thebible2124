This isn’t a lesson. It’s a space. Come as you are. Let the line speak to you.

[FILE TAGS]
[LINE ID]: 00099
[BOOK]: Genesis
[CHAPTER]: 4
[VERSE]: 19
[FILE TYPE]: Line Rendering

[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And Lamech took for himself two wives. The name of the one was Adah, and the name of the second was Zillah.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Took for himself” (וַיִּקַּח לוֹ) reflects the reflexive nuance of the preposition + pronoun, indicating agency and possession.
“Two wives” (שְׁתֵּי נָשִׁים) uses the dual numeral construct — feminine, indicating paired feminine individuals.
Names are introduced with parallel phrasing: “The name of the one…” / “and the name of the second…”
“Adah” (עָדָה) and “Zillah” (צִלָּה) are personal names with poetic/semantic undertones ("adornment" and "shade" respectively).
Use of definite articles (ה) reinforces individual distinction between the two women.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“Was” added for fluid rendering of verbless nominal clauses.
“And” reflects original vav conjunction.
“For himself” interprets prepositional-pronominal pairing explicitly.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Marks the first biblical mention of polygamy.
Launches a new phase in the Cainite genealogy, now expanding from vertical descent to horizontal multiplication.
Sets up identities of Adah and Zillah — important for tracing the named offspring in upcoming verses.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Syntactic parallelism between “the name of the one…” and “the name of the second…” provides poetic symmetry.
Continuity from Line_00098: Lamech now shifts from being a son to becoming a patriarch.
The line introduces a triadic structure that unfolds over Lines 00099–00101 (wives → children → vocations).
