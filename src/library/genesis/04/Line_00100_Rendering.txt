[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And Adah bore Jabal. He was the father of those who dwell in tents and with livestock.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Vatteled” = “she bore” or “she gave birth” — standard Qal imperfect with vav-consecutive.
“Et-Yaval” = “Jabal” (personal name) marked by direct object marker; Hebrew spelling יָבָל.
“Hu hayah avi…” = appositional clause; “he was the father of…” defines identity via function.
“Yoshev ohel u-miqneh” = participial phrase meaning “one who dwells in tent and livestock” — a compound occupational identity.
Construct form “avi yoshev” indicates vocational descent — not literal biological exclusivity.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“Was” added for English rendering of past-tense Qal perfect “hayah.”
“Those who” added to express participial group implied by construct “avi yoshev.”
“With” supplied to reflect linkage between tent and livestock (u-miqneh) without assuming dual professions.
Definite article not inserted; specificity implied but not stated in Hebrew.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

First of three vocational offspring attributed to Lamech’s wives.
This child (Jabal) becomes associated with nomadic-herding culture.
Cain’s lineage now linked to early social specialization — a shift from mere reproduction to civilization.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Mirrors upcoming lines introducing Jubal (music) and Tubal-cain (metalwork).
Each child is tied to a human domain — this one: mobility + economy.
Jabal is presented not only as an individual, but as a vocational progenitor — “father of dwellers.”
Opens a triptych of societal archetypes passed through maternal lineages.
