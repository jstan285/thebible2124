[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

Sentence divides into two parts: birth declaration and role identification.
“Vatteled Adah et-Yaval” is a direct genealogical clause.
“Hu hayah avi …” forms an explanatory apposition—identifying the child’s vocational lineage.
Construct form “avi yoshev” links fatherhood with occupational designation.
Dual spheres: “tent” (dwelling) and “livestock” (economic role).

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

LXX renders name as “Jabal” and keeps basic clause structure.
Samaritan Pentateuch conforms to MT.
No DSS variant known for this verse.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Continues the line of Lamech’s descendants (Line_00099).
Begins vocational identity motif in Cainite genealogy, echoed in Jubal (music) and Tubal-cain (metalwork).
Sets thematic contrast with later agricultural and nomadic developments.
