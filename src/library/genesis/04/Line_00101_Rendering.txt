[YOU ARE WELCOME HERE]
This isn’t a lesson. It’s a space. Come as you are. Let the line speak to you.

[FILE TAGS]
[LINE ID]: 00101
[BOOK]: Genesis
[CHAPTER]: 4
[VERSE]: 21
[FILE TYPE]: Line Rendering

[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And the name of his brother was Jubal. He was the father of all who handle the lyre and pipe.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Ve-shem achiv” = “and the name of his brother” — parallel to previous verse’s syntactic pattern.
“Yubal” = proper name, with possible associations to “stream” or “bringing forth.”
“Hu hayah avi…” = identity clause designating originator role.
“Kol-tofesh kinnor ve-ugav” = construct phrase meaning “all who handle lyre and pipe.”
“Tofesh” (participle) implies skillful, ongoing interaction — not mere possession.
“Kinnor” = lyre or stringed instrument; “ugav” = wind instrument, perhaps reed flute.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“Was” inserted for the past tense verb “hayah.”
“Of” added to render construct form “avi kol-tofesh.”
“Who” supplied to clarify participial phrase as a group identity.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Second in a triad of culturally foundational offspring from Lamech’s line.
Establishes the emergence of music and craftsmanship in early human society.
Juxtaposes with previous line’s nomadic herding (Line_00100) and anticipates metallurgy (Line_00102).

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Reinforces poetic-parallel structure: “[mother] bore [son]; he was father of [domain].”
Complements “tent and livestock” with “lyre and pipe” — material culture alongside artistic expression.
Introduces breath-based and string-based instruments — duality of musical mediums.
