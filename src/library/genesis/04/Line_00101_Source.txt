[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

The line mirrors Genesis 4:20 in both form and flow: name declaration + occupational identity.
“Avi kol-tofesh …” construct parallels “avi yoshev …” in previous line, linking genealogical and vocational foundations.
Double instrument pairing (string + wind) introduces first mention of musical craftsmanship in Hebrew scripture.
Phrase “kol-tofesh” emphasizes practice or skill through participial form.

LXX reflects similar structure, transliterating names and instrument types (e.g., kinnor as kinura).
No significant deviation in Samaritan Pentateuch.
DSS fragments do not cover this verse.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Continuation of Lamech’s lineage (Line_00099, Line_00100).
Establishes Jubal as cultural archetype — “father of all who play.”
Joins Cainite pattern of vocational innovation: tent/livestock (Jabal), music (Jubal), metallurgy (Tubal-cain, next line).
Builds triadic arc in cultural origins narrative.
