[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

Line follows pattern of Genesis 4:20–21 but includes expanded vocational detail.
“Gam-hi yaldah” emphasizes continuation and inclusion.
Participial structure “lotesh kol-choresh…” defines Tubal-cain’s expertise.
“Kol-choresh” may imply archetypal role, not merely individual skill.
Final clause introduces Naamah without elaboration—distinct from prior male vocational lists.
Structural symmetry and gender pairing present but asymmetrical in detail.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

LXX transliterates names and uses terms for smithing/artisan work.
Samaritan Pentateuch agrees with MT in structure and name forms.
No DSS fragments known for this verse.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Final installment in Lamech’s generational triad (Jabal, Jubal, Tubal-cain).
Introduces metallurgy as human innovation, expanding Cainite contributions to civilization.
Naamah’s naming may anticipate her relevance (not detailed here).
Sets up transition to Lamech’s speech in Genesis 4:23 (Line_00103).
