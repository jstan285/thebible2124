[YOU ARE WELCOME HERE]
This isn’t a lesson. It’s a space. Come as you are. Let the line speak to you.

[FILE TAGS]
[LINE ID]: 00103
[BOOK]: Genesis
[CHAPTER]: 4
[VERSE]: 23
[FILE TYPE]: Line Rendering

[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And Lamech said to his wives: Adah and Zillah, listen to my voice — wives of Lamech, give ear to my word: For I have killed a man for my wound, and a youth for my bruise.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Vayomer Lamech lenashav” = formal speech opening, marks shift to poetic address.
Double imperative (“shma’an … ha’zenah”) — both feminine plural, invoking ritual or formal tone.
“Ish … haragti” = “I killed a man,” direct and personal declaration.
“Lefitzi … lechabburati” = “for my wound … for my bruise” — possessive, possibly justifying action.
“Yeled” can mean “child,” “youth,” or simply “young one” — ambiguity retained.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“To” inserted before “his wives” for syntactical clarity.
Colon added after “wives” for spoken-text formatting.
Em dashes used to clarify poetic structure between parallel commands.
“For” added before “I have killed” to preserve Hebrew causal construction (“ki”).

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

First biblical poetic speech by a human character.
Spoken by Lamech, seventh in Cain’s line, following triad of cultural founders.
Immediately precedes Line_00104, which continues the poem.
Reflects deepening of Cainite themes: violence, pride, self-justification.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Builds directly from Line_00102 — closes genealogical arc with personal speech.
Sets up poetic dyad: Line_00103 (action) and Line_00104 (comparison/boast).
Echoes earlier fratricidal language (Cain and Abel), refracted through poetic boast.
