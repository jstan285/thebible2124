[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

Formal poetic speech: double imperative followed by declarative clauses.
Feminine plural commands addressed directly to Lamech’s wives—unusual grammatical pattern.
Internal parallelism between “shma’an qoli” and “ha’zenah imrati.”
“Ki … haragti” clause is assertive; structure implies causality or justification.
Use of singular “ish” and “yeled” introduces ambiguity in referents.
Lexical repetition reinforces emotional and rhythmic cadence.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

LXX follows structure closely but varies in intensity of terms (e.g., translates “yeled” as “young man”).
No major variant from Samaritan Pentateuch.
DSS fragments do not preserve this portion.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Begins poetic speech concluded in Genesis 4:24 (Line_00104).
Reflects culmination of Lamech lineage section (Lines_00099–00102).
Thematic resonance with violence motifs from earlier Cain narrative (Lines_00081–00096).
Anticipates ethical and narrative contrasts with the Sethite line in Genesis 5.
