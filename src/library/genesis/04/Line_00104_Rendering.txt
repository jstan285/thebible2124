[YOU ARE WELCOME HERE]
This isn’t a lesson. It’s a space. Come as you are. Let the line speak to you.

[FILE TAGS]
[LINE ID]: 00104
[BOOK]: Genesis
[CHAPTER]: 4
[VERSE]: 24
[FILE TYPE]: Line Rendering

[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

If Cain is avenged sevenfold, then Lamech seventy and sevenfold.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Ki” can mean “if,” “for,” or “indeed”—rendered here as “if” to reflect conditional logic.
“Shiv‘atayim” = “sevenfold” — intensifier from root seven (sheva).
“Yuqqam” = passive verb “shall be avenged” — form: Pual imperfect, indicating expected or decreed future action.
“Qayin” = proper name Cain.
“Ve-lemekh shiv‘im ve-shiv‘ah” = “and Lamech seventy and seven” — read as “seventy-sevenfold” to parallel and escalate Cain’s avenging.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“Is” and “then” added to clarify implied conditional structure.
“Avenged” drawn directly from “yuqqam” (Pual form of “qum”) — passive causative nuance preserved.
No smoothing or interpretive additions beyond clarity markers.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Concludes Lamech’s poetic declaration from the previous verse (Line_00103).
Serves as final spoken line in Cainite genealogy narrative arc.
Offers a twisted mirror of divine protection promised to Cain (Line_00095).
Introduces multiplicative escalation — vengeance as a compounded response.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Mirrors and intensifies Genesis 4:15 — thematic recursion with numeric amplification.
Pairs with Line_00103 to form a self-contained poem (double verse, double line).
Precedes genealogical shift and prepares ground for contrast with Sethite line in Genesis 4:25.
