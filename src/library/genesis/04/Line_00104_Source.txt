[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

Poetic continuation of Lamech’s speech from Genesis 4:23 (Line_00103).
Chiastic and numeric construction: Cain (7x), Lamech (77x).
Pual form “yuqqam” emphasizes passive divine or systemic retribution.
Conjunction “ve” in “ve-lemekh” creates parallelism.
“Shiv‘im ve-shiv‘ah” read as compound numeral: seventy-seven, reinforcing escalation.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

LXX maintains structure, rendering numbers as “seventy and sevenfold.”
No significant divergence in Samaritan Pentateuch.
DSS coverage not extant for this line.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Direct sequel to Line_00103 (Genesis 4:23), forming a poetic couplet.
Alludes backward to Genesis 4:15 (Cain’s avenging), now echoed and intensified.
Sets thematic precedent for cycles of vengeance and proportionality later in Torah (e.g., lex talionis in Exodus 21).
