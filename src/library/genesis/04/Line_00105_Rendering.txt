[YOU ARE WELCOME HERE]
This isn’t a lesson. It’s a space. Come as you are. Let the line speak to you.

[FILE TAGS]
[LINE ID]: 00105
[BOOK]: Genesis
[CHAPTER]: 4
[VERSE]: 25
[FILE TYPE]: Line Rendering

[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and called his name Seth, for God appointed for me another seed in place of Abel, because Cain killed him.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Vayyéda‘” = “and he knew” — idiomatically denotes sexual union.
“‘Od” = “again” — emphasizes continuity or renewal.
“Ishto” = “his wife” — direct reference to Eve.
“Vatteled ben” = “and she bore a son” — typical birth formula.
“Vattiqra et-shemo” = “and she called his name” — naming action by the mother.
“Shet” = Seth — phonetic and semantic wordplay with “shat-li” (“he appointed for me”).
“Ki shat-li elohim” = “for God appointed for me” — attribution of divine intervention.
“Zera acher” = “another seed” — continuation of lineage despite loss.
“Tachat hevel” = “in place of Abel” — overt replacement language.
“Ki harago qayin” = “because Cain killed him” — cause for Abel’s absence.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“Again” drawn directly from “‘od.”
“Because” (second instance of “ki”) added to distinguish causal clause.
No smoothing or extrapolation introduced.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Marks a re-centering of the human story after the Cain and Abel crisis.
Introduces Seth as both a restoration and a transition toward a new genealogical line.
Frames divine appointment as the source of ongoing lineage.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Mirrors Genesis 4:1 (Line_00080) structurally and thematically: birth, naming, attribution to God.
Bridges Cain’s line (Genesis 4) and the Sethite genealogy (Genesis 5).
Final narrative act in the Cain cycle — shifts focus to divine continuity.
