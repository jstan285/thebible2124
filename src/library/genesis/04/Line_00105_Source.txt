[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

“Vayyéda‘ … vatteled … vattiqra” forms classic narrative sequence.
Wordplay between “Shet” (name) and “shat-li” (he appointed for me).
The preposition “tachat” emphasizes replacement or substitution in the context of Abel’s death.
Parallel constructions enhance semantic weight: “zera acher … tachat hevel” // “ki harago qayin.”

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

LXX confirms overall structure, rendering Seth’s naming and the divine role in appointment.
Samaritan Pentateuch aligns closely with MT.
No DSS variants attested for this verse.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Thematic resolution to the Cain/Abel arc (Lines_00081–00096).
Introduces new genealogical line through Seth, transitioning to Genesis 5.
Echoes Genesis 4:1’s structure in its birth and naming formula.
