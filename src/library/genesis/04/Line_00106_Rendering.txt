This isn’t a lesson. It’s a space. Come as you are. Let the line speak to you.

[FILE TAGS]
[LINE ID]: 00106
[BOOK]: Genesis
[CHAPTER]: 4
[VERSE]: 26
[FILE TYPE]: Line Rendering

[INTRO]
This file gives a minimal English phrasing of the original line, built directly from the Line Source File.
It’s readable, but not smoothed. Nothing is added beyond what’s traceable.

[RENDERED LINE]

And to Seth also a son was born, and he called his name Enosh. Then it was begun to call upon the name of YHWH.

[RENDERING NOTES]

“Ul-shet” = “and to Seth” — marks transition in lineage focus.
“Gam-hu” = “also he” — signals continuity and emphasis on Seth’s line.
“Yullad” = passive form of “was born” — sets Enosh’s arrival as eventful, not agent-driven.
“Vayiqra et-shemo Enosh” = “and he called his name Enosh” — standard naming construction.
“Az huchal” = “then it was begun” — ambiguous passive verb (see notes).
“Liqro beshem YHWH” = “to call upon the name of YHWH” — core phrase initiating public invocation.

[INSERTION / HELPER WORD TRACKING]

“Then it was begun to” = reflects passive verbal nuance of “huchal.”
“Upon” supplied in “call upon” for clarity — traceable to “beshem.”
No additional smoothing or extrapolation introduced.

[CONTEXTUAL PLACEMENT]

Marks the shift from genealogical narrative to spiritual invocation.
First textual moment of collective or ritualized naming of the divine.
Links Sethite line to future covenantal consciousness.

[STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT NOTES]

Closes chapter-long contrast between Cainite and Sethite legacy.
Builds anticipatory thread to Genesis 12:8, Exodus 34:5, and Levitical rituals of invocation.
Wordplay and ambiguity around “huchal” reflect dual potential: sacred beginning vs. potential profaning.
