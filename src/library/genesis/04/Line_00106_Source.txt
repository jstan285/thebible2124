[INTRO]
This file shows what the earliest Hebrew/Greek manuscripts say, word by word, before any interpretation.

[PREFACE]
This file presents the earliest traceable form of this line, drawn primarily from manuscript sources like the Leningrad Codex.
Where other manuscript witnesses differ or offer meaningful variation (such as the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Samaritan Pentateuch), we remain watchful and will note those cases transparently when identified.
Every word is shown with its full lexical range — without smoothing, interpretation, or insertion.
This is not a translation or conclusion. It is a transparent starting point, open to personal encounter and divine resonance.
We do not treat any human source as final — only as visible reference points for deeper unfolding.
While we strive for care and clarity, any oversight or omission is unintentional, and all work remains open to refinement as understanding grows.

[4. STRUCTURAL NOTES]

The passive “yullad” introduces Enosh’s birth in contrast to active “yalad” forms in earlier lines.
Shift from lineage narration to communal ritual act: “huchal liqro beshem YHWH.”
Debate over verb “huchal” centers on whether meaning is “began” (initiated) or “was profaned”; the form supports both depending on context.
Word pair “liqro beshem” recurs throughout Torah for acts of invocation and naming.

[5. VARIANT MANUSCRIPT NOTES]

LXX translates “huchal” as “began,” implying public invocation of deity.
No alternate readings confirmed in Samaritan Pentateuch.
DSS fragments do not cover this verse.

[6. STRUCTURAL CONNECTION TO OTHER LINES]

Culminates Genesis 4 genealogy, closing the Cain/Seth division (Lines_00081–00106).
Thematic shift from familial to communal, from violence to invocation.
Sets theological precedent for “calling on the name of YHWH” as covenantal act (cf. Genesis 12:8, Exodus 34:5).
