<h1>Library</h1>

<p>Welcome to the Library — the living heart of The Bible 2124.</p>

<p>This is where the translation unfolds, one line at a time.</p>
<p>Each chapter you see here is a doorway into something ancient made new — translated with care, traced with transparency, and offered openly for reflection, resonance, and return.</p>

<p>The work you’ll find here is in motion. Translations appear gradually as they’re completed — shaped not by speed, but by reverence.</p>
<p>Every word is sourced, documented, and built to be studied as deeply as it is read.</p>

<p>You’re invited to explore freely.</p>
<p>Wander.</p>
<p>Wonder.</p>
<p>Begin where you’re drawn.</p>
<p>There is no right order — only your own unfolding path.</p>

<p>Wherever you begin, may the words meet you in just the way you need — and draw you gently deeper into the mystery and love beneath them.</p>
