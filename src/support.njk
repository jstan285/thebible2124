  <h1>Support</h1>
  <h2>Thank you for being here.</h2>

  <p><b>The Bible 2124</b> is a quiet labor of love — a project rooted in reverence, clarity, and the belief that God’s word can speak freshly and freely to all who seek it.</p>
  
  <p>Each line we translate, each reference we trace, each page we build — all of it is done with care, transparency, and trust in a deeper unfolding.</p>

  <p>This is an independent, love-led effort. There is no institution behind us. No marketing campaign. Just a vision — a path we are walking, line by line.</p>

  <p>If this work resonates with you, and you feel moved to support its unfolding, your gift helps us dedicate more time, energy, and attention to this mission. Every offering, no matter the size or form, makes a difference — helping us translate, document, and build this resource for all to access freely.</p>

  <h2>Ways to Support</h2>

  <p>
    The Bible 2124 is not a nonprofit or registered charity. We are not governed by any institution or external structure. As such, we cannot provide tax deductions or receipts. All support is received as a personal gift — freely given, without obligation, and used to sustain this work and keep it openly available to all.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the message has spoken to you and you're moved to support its continued growth, your gift is deeply appreciated.

  <h3>Support Through Prayer or Intention</h3>
  <p>If giving today would create even the smallest hardship, we ask for nothing but your blessing.</p>
  <p>Imagine this project flourishing. Imagine it reaching those who need it. Your quiet hope is powerful.</p>

  <h2>A Note From the Heart</h2>
  <p>We trust that what is needed will be provided — not by pressure, but by resonance.</p>
  <p>Whether your support comes as a gift, a prayer, or a kind word passed along to someone who might need this — you are part of this story. As the project matures, we look forward to honoring those who have helped make it possible, including invitations to be acknowledged in future forewords or shared moments of gratitude.</p>
  <p>With open hands and deep thanks, we continue forward — together.</p>
